In the digital age, streaming services such as Spotify have changed
the way people consume music, highlighting the enormous influence these platforms have on the market. In the highly competitive
music industry, it is crucial for independent artists in particular to
maintain their popularity. This is especially true in countries like
Brazil, where geographical and cultural differences influence music
consumption patterns. Understanding these patterns is essential for
effective marketing and production strategies. Despite previous research on music consumption, genre preferences and user behavior,
there is a lack of detailed studies on the geographical and cultural
distribution of music preferences in Brazil. Our study fills this gap
by examining musical genre preferences and acoustic features of
tracks across Brazilian regions over two years. We collected Spotify chart data from 2022 and 2023, modeled bipartite genre-city
networks, and used backbone extraction methods to highlight significant genre preferences. Temporal analysis revealed patterns and
persistence of musical preferences across cities, while clustering
techniques revealed regional and cultural differences in acoustic
features. Our results show that genre preferences are stable across
Brazilian regions, with important genres emphasized by backbone
networks. Persistence analysis suggests minimal changes over time,
except during major holidays. Furthermore, Brazilian city clusters
exhibit distinct acoustic patterns regardless of music genres, with
notable differences in features such as liveliness, speechiness, and
valence. This research provides new insights into regional musical
diversity in Brazil and paves the way for future studies on cultural
and geographical influences on music preferences.

### **1 INTRODUCTION**

In the digital era, streaming services have revolutionized the way
people consume media content, particularly music [ 3, 8, 12 ]. The
number of music streaming subscribers worldwide increased from
616 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022 to 713 million
in the third quarter of 2023 [ 26 ]. As a result, paid music streaming
subscriptions have become the norm for many music fans and
have led to impressive growth in subscriber numbers in recent
years. This surge in popularity has led to music streaming services

accounting for a significant portion of the music industry’s revenue,
demonstrating their significant influence on the market and the
steady global expansion of these platforms [ 4, 8, 36 ]. Among the
various music streaming services, Spotify stands out as a profitable
player. In 2023, Spotify paid out more than 9 billion dollars to
artists, one of the highest annual payouts by a single provider
in history [1] . What factors contribute to the persistence of these
regional patterns?
In parallel, the music industry is highly competitive, and maintaining popularity and influence is crucial for artists, especially for
independent ones [ 32 ]. Expertise in production and promotion offers substantial advantages in this landscape [ 5 ]. In large countries
such as Brazil, this knowledge is even more important due to the
great geographic and cultural diversity [ 45 ]. A music popular in
the South may not resonate in the North, and vice versa. Thanks
to extensive data from streaming platforms such as Spotify, it is
now possible to understand the geographical distribution of music preferences [ 30 ]. Mapping regional popular music is the first
step toward identifying the profile of a region and testing relevant
marketing strategies [ 45 ]. This profiling, carried out through a temporal analysis, assesses the common characteristics associated with
popular music and their cultural significance.
Indeed, several prior efforts have concentrated on studying music popularity within groups [ 2, 37 ], geographical distribution of
music preferences [ 7, 25, 30, 45 ], user demographics and personality [ 6, 43 ], and music diversity [ 20, 31, 46 ]. However, these studies
do not capture the regional behaviors of these groups in terms of
genre preferences, especially in the Brazilian context. Given the
significant role that music streaming platforms play in the distribution and consumption of music, it is important to understand
the composition of musical preferences in different regions [ 6, 15 ].
In Brazil, with its diverse cultural landscape, this understanding is
particularly important for artists, producers, and marketers who
want to tailor their strategies to regional tastes [ 13, 17, 47 ]. With
this in mind, this study seeks to fill this gap by examining and
characterizing the musical genre preferences and audio features
of tracks in different regions of Brazil over a two-year period on
Spotify charts. In this way, we aim to gain valuable insights into the
regional musical landscape that can improve marketing strategies,
production decisions, and promotional activities. Our study aims
to address the following research questions:

**—RQ1:** How do preferences for musical genres differ in different
Brazilian cities over the years? What factors contribute to the persistence of these regional patterns?

**—RQ2:** To what extent do the acoustic features of the tracks reflect
regional and cultural patterns in Brazil, independent of their musical
genres? Furthermore, are there acoustic differences within the same
musical genre across different regions?

To tackle these research questions, we collected data from Spotify
charts for the years 2022 and 2023. We modeled genre-city bipartite networks and applied a state-of-the-art backbone extraction
method to highlight significant genre preferences while respecting
the heterogeneity of musical tastes across different cities. Using
this refined topology, we conducted a temporal analysis to identify patterns and persistence in musical preferences, addressing
RQ1. For RQ2, we generated features from the backbone network
and applied clustering techniques to uncover regional and cultural
variations in the intrinsic acoustic features of tracks. This involved
profiling clusters based on their acoustic characteristics and identifying significant differences within the same genre in different
regions. Our results show that preferences for musical genres in
Brazilian cities exhibit a stable set of preferred genres, with backbone networks highlighting the most important ones. Moreover, we
observed balanced preferences, while persistence analysis indicated
minimal changes over time, except during important holidays. Regarding RQ2, Brazilian city clusters showed different audio patterns
in tracks, regardless of musical genres. We found significant differences in features such as *liveness*, *speechiness*, and *valence* between
clusters with similar genre preferences, indicating regional and
cultural differences in musical preferences and acoustic nuances
within the same genres in different regions.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section
2, we discuss related works. In Section 3, we describe the method
of data crawling and the generated dataset. Section 4 details our
methodology in four steps. In Section 5, we present our results
in discuss our findings for RQ1 and RQ2. Finally, in Section 6, we
conclude and propose ideas for future research.
### **2 RELATED WORKS**

Some works aim to understand the distribution of music consumption in a population [ 7, 42, 43, 46 ], focusing on various aspects.
These include consumption patterns [ 37, 42 ], genre preferences

[ 22, 25, 27, 30, 45 ], user behavior [ 8, 14 ], the temporal evolution
of music preferences [ 12, 41 ], the impact of marketing campaigns

[ 5, 32 ], the influence of social events [ 10, 24 ], user demographics
and personality [ 6, 43 ], the effects of algorithmic recommendations

[33, 40], and musical diversity [20, 31].
Focusing on consumption patterns, Ren and Kauffman [37] built
a machine learning model to predict the popularity of new releases
on streaming platforms, uncovering patterns that remain common
to popular music, such as tracks staying at the top of the charts
for long periods. Similarly, Terroso-Saenz et al . [42] developed an
algorithm to detect music propagation patterns on Spotify across
different countries, finding strong correlations with cultural and
social similarities. Our goal is different, as we want to identify the
most popular music in each city, excluding national hits and making
correlations between cities based on their popular music to describe
possible geographical and cultural connections.
In terms of genre preferences, Mondelli et al . [30] used a networkbased approach to analyze communities of countries with similar


musical genre preferences, finding that most communities are culturally and/or geographically related. They also showed that Brazil
is unique, with its top genres primarily originating from its own
culture. Jiang et al . [22] found that new releases with functional
purposes are less consumed, and popular genres like *pop* do not
always equate to high consumption rates. Our study focuses on
genre preferences in the different regions of Brazil. It emphasizes
the country’s cultural and geographical diversity and reinforces
the idea that the most popular music genres in Brazil come from
within the country.
Lee and Cunningham [25] presented hierarchical groups of countries with similar genre preferences, identifying leader-follower relations where leaders are defined by their historical production and
consumption of a genre. Although determining the origin of genres
in the Brazilian regions is not our primary research question, we
address it by recognizing sub-genres that indicate regional origins
and identifying national genres that are predominantly listened to
in specific areas. Similarly, Vaz de Melo et al . [45] identified digital music consumption patterns in each state but did not reveal
differences. Our goal is to highlight these differences by analyzing the track acoustic features of similar genres and sub-genres in
different regions, connecting users geographically through similar
preferences, and revealing regional differences.
Regarding user demographics and personality, Tricomi et al . [43]
linked Spotify users’ playlists to their demographic and personality
traits, finding that similar playlists are created by users with similar
profiles. Bello and Garcia [6] explored cross-country diversity in
music charts over four years, revealing a trend towards greater
diversity in global digital music consumption. In the area of musical
diversity, Way et al . [46] found that the preference for local content
increased in various genres from 2014 to 2019. Hesmondhalgh [20]
argued that streaming platforms encourage music to have certain
characteristics and thus influence the listener’s aesthetic experience.
Morris [31] investigated the “platform effects” on users’ musical
tastes and found that music acts like data, putting pressure on
musicians and producers to adapt to platform trends.
Our study contributes to the literature by providing a longitudinal analysis of the geographical and cultural distribution of music
preferences in Brazil. Using data from a two-year period, we examine how genre preferences and track acoustic features differ from
region to region, offering new insights into the regional diversity
of musical tastes in Brazil. Our research fills a gap in the understanding of regional music consumption and provides a basis for
future studies on cultural and geographical influences on music
preferences.
### **3 DATASET**

To analyze Brazil’s musical preferences geographically, we use
the Spotify Charts [2] . This service summarizes the daily Top 200
most listened to songs in a specific region, referred to as a “chart”.
We collected the weekly rankings of all available Brazilian cities
on the platform from 2022 to 2023. Each chart contains essential
information about all tracks, including the track name, artist names,
and the Spotify identifier for each track. Additionally, we used these
identifiers to query for acoustic features and genres of each track

using the Spotify API for Developers [3] . Some core features described
by Spotify are as follows:

**—Acousticness** measures from 0.0 to 1.0 whether the track is

acoustic; 1.0 indicates an acoustic song, while 0.0 means a song
without any acoustic elements.
**—Danceability** describes from 0.0 to 1.0 how suitable the track is
for dancing based on a combination of musical elements; higher
values indicate greater danceability.
**—Energy** measures from 0.0 to 1.0 how intense a track is.
**—Liveness** detects the presence of an audience in the recording
on a scale between 0.0 and 1.0.

**—Speechiness** detects the presence of spoken words in a track;
the more exclusively speech-like the recording, the closer to 1.0 the
attribute value.

**—Valence** ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the positivity of a track.
Values close to 1.0 indicate happy, positive, and euphoric songs,
while low values sound more negative, sad, depressed, or angry.

The dataset includes 5190 unique tracks, 487 genres, and 2056
artists. Geographically, we cover 17 cities across 16 states, namely:
Belém, Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Campinas, Campo Grande, Cuiabá,
Curitiba, Florianópolis, Fortaleza, Goiânia, Manaus, Porto Alegre,
Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, São Paulo, and Uberlândia. Unfortunately, other cities – especially the countryside – could not be
covered by this study due to their absence on the Spotify Charts platform. However, those mentioned above represent the five regions of
Brazil (North, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, and South), providing
a comprehensive geographical perspective of the country’s music
preferences. Thus, we extend the literature with a detailed analysis
of the temporal, geographical and cultural distribution of music
preferences in Brazil across different regions.
### **4 METHODOLOGY**

This section presents our methodology, including the steps for
answering each RQ.
### **4.1 Modeling musical genre preferences**

Aiming to answer our RQ’s, we start by discretizing the two-year
period into bimonthly windows. We then adopted network models for each period Δ *𝜏*, specifically bipartite networks. Formally,
the bipartite network B [∆] *[𝜏]* = ( *𝑉* *𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑟𝑒* *,𝑉* *𝐶𝑖𝑡𝑦* *, 𝐸* [Δ] *[𝜏]* ) consists of the
following elements: *𝑉* *𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑟𝑒* is the set of all music genres, *𝑉* *𝐶𝑖𝑡𝑦* is
the set of all cities, and *𝐸* [Δ] *[𝜏]* is the set of directed edges ( *𝑔,𝑐,𝑤* *𝑔𝑐* [Δ] *[𝜏]* [)] [,]

where *𝑔* ∈ *𝑉* *𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑟𝑒* and *𝑐* ∈ *𝑉* *𝐶𝑖𝑡𝑦* . The weight *𝑤* *𝑔𝑐* [Δ] *[𝜏]* [represents the]
number of unique tracks of a genre *𝑔* that appear in the Spotify
chart of city *𝑐* during the period Δ *𝜏* .
Then, we use instances of B [∆] *[𝜏]* to identify cities with common
genre preferences. However, our analysis revealed that these networks often resulted in highly dense structures, where each node
was strongly linked with many others. This density made it challenging to extract meaningful information about common preferences.
This phenomenon is similar to the observations in prior efforts

[ 30 ], who also faced difficulties due to the dense nature of their
networks. They found that certain genres were universally popular,

3 Spotify API for Developers: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api


appearing in charts across multiple countries, resulting in an overly
connected network.

To address the issue of overly dense networks, we employ a network backbone extraction method [ 16, 29, 34 ]. Since not all edges
are equally significant for comprehension, as tracks and genres can
be influenced by side effects such as singer popularity, we propose
adopting *backbone* extraction algorithms to filter through the noise
and unveil only the most relevant edges, resulting in a subset of the
initial network [ 9 ]. There are several backbone extraction methods
in the literature [ 16 ]. Some of these methods are used to explore network heterogeneity by identifying salient edges with significantly
higher weights based on local individual patterns (e.g., Polya Urn
Filter and Disparity Filter) or global network patterns (e.g., Thresholding), representing persistent and repetitive interactions [ 28, 39 ].
Local methods, in particular, are probabilistic methods that build
*null models* for each node and can capture, from a local perspective,
how salient an edge is according to its weight. A review of these
methods for this context is available in the literature [16].
We determined that the most valuable edges – also called *salient*
edges – in our context are not necessarily the weakest or strongest
across all cities but those that have exceptional weights from the
perspective of each city. In other words, these are the genres that
appear most frequently in the charts of the individual cities, taking
into account the popularity of the city and the genre. The main
assumption is that these edges will not exhibit a uniform behavior
across all cities but will show specific deviation patterns for smaller
sets of cities. Thus, we employ the Polya Urn Filter [ 29 ], a backbone
extraction method inspired by the Pólya urn combinatorial model.
This method takes into account the reinforcement hypothesis of
interactions between the same two nodes over time (i.e., a genre
with a high presence in the listened genres of a city over the studied
time windows is a salient link), presuming these edges are maintained and reinforced [ 29 ]. The method is controlled by a given
*alpha*, which is used to determine the probability for the statistical
significance of an edge according to the null model of the Pólya-Urn
filter, and by a reinforcement parameter, which may be self-tuned.
We advocate the use of this method, as opposed to the thresholds used by other authors [ 1 ], because it is advantageous when
observing cities and genre preferences, as it takes into account
the heterogeneity of the data. For example, a genre may appear 10
times in the chart of one city and 100 times in another, creating
edges with the corresponding weights. Both edges can remain in
the backbone and connect the genre in both cities. This is possible
because from the perspective of the first city, 10 occurrences may
be significant when other genres only occur 1, 2 or 3 times. In this
way, this approach respects the heterogeneity of edge weights in
the networks.

The execution of the Polya Urn Filter reveals the most statistically significant edges of the network, and we retained edges with
a *p-value <* 0 *.* 05, corresponding to a 95% confidence level. By extracting the backbone of B [∆] *[𝜏]*, we generated B [∆] *[𝜏]*
Backbone [, identifying]
the most listened-to genres in each city for each period. Overall,
we aim to capture significant patterns in genre preferences across
different cities using B [∆] *[𝜏]*
Backbone [.]
Given the bimonthly sequence of bipartite backbone networks
B [∆] *[𝜏]*
Backbone [, we start by analyzing how genre preferences vary and]

persist across cities. We focus on the distribution of genre popularity
in each city (i.e., whether all genres in the backbone are listened to
with the same intensity). To measure this distribution variation, we
calculated the Gini index, a well-established conventional measure
of income inequality [ 11 ], for the genres in the backbone for each
city. First, for each city and time window Δ *𝜏*, we sorted the genre
link weights in its corresponding backbone and used them as input


to the following Gini equation *𝐺* = [2] *𝑛* [�] [�] *[𝑛]* *𝑖* = *[𝑛]* *𝑖* = 1 1 *[𝑖]* [·] *[𝑦]* *[𝑦]* *[𝑖][𝑖]* [−] *[𝑛]* *𝑛* [+][1] [.]

In this definition, *𝑛* is the total number of genres, *𝑦* *𝑖* is the *𝑖* -th
link weight in the sorted set, [�] *[𝑛]* *𝑖* =1 *[𝑦]* *[𝑖]* [is the sum of all weights, and]
� *𝑛𝑖* =1 *[𝑖]* [·] *[𝑦]* *[𝑖]* [is the weighted sum of the values in the set, where] *[ 𝑖]* [is the]
index of the value. The second term, *[𝑛]* *𝑛* [+][1] [, is the normalization that]

guarantees that the value is between 0 and 1, where 0 means equally
distributed and 1 means unequally distributed. In this way, we want
to find out if the cities still have differences in these preferences
according to their preferred genres in the backbone, essentially
identifying the most preferred among the preferred genres.
Next, we analyzed the persistence of genre preferences over time
by examining the fraction of genres that remain in the backbone
across sequential periods Δ *𝜏* and Δ *𝜏* +1 for each city. Our main idea
here is to determine whether cities have a well-defined collection of
preferred genres that persist over the entire period. These analyses
allow us to understand how genre preferences vary across cities
in Brazil over the years, addressing **RQ1** . They also help us to
identify the regional factors that contribute to the persistence of
these patterns, as described in the next section.
### **4.2 Modeling track acoustic features and** **regional patterns**

Recall that the goal of RQ2 is to understand the track acoustic features to reveal regional patterns of the preferred tracks in different
cities and even within a genre in different regions. To achieve this,
we first use the information about music and genre preferences
obtained from the backbones, as described in the previous section.
However, the edges of such backbones do not encode the many
dimensions that make up the track acoustic features (detailed in
Section 3), so multivariate analysis is required. Given the persistence of the genres analyzed in RQ1, as we will discuss in Section
5, we assume that cities show very small variation of preferred
genres listened to over time, making temporal analysis redundant.
Therefore, we opted for analyzing a unique aggregated view of the
regional time period on the track acoustic features. Then, we use
the genre preference information from the backbones from RQ1,
gather the track acoustic features, perform feature engineering, and
use K-means clustering on these features to create clusters that
tackle our RQ2, as detailed below.
From the backbones B [∆] *[𝜏]*
Backbone [, which capture the preferences of]
genres, for each city *𝑐* *𝑖* a set of tracks *𝑆* *𝑐* *𝑖* is built. This set *𝑆* *𝑐* *𝑖* consists
of the tracks from genres that belong to the backbone of genres
linked to city *𝑐* *𝑖* in *𝑉* *𝐶𝑖𝑡𝑦* . However, we noticed that the same genre,
preferred by two or more cities according to our backbone, may or
may not have become preferred because of the same tracks. Thus,
we observed that popular tracks of various genres appear in many
cities, while others are exclusive to a given city. In the first case,
these tracks are national hits of the genre, which do not contribute


to revealing specific regional patterns. In the second case, they
are tracks capable of revealing regional particularities, which are
closely related to our objectives here. Based on this observation, for
each city *𝑐* *𝑖*, we have discarded instances of tracks that are listened
to in at least one other city (e.g., a track is only kept in the set if
it is exclusively represented in the chart by the city in question).
Thus, each city has a representative and exclusive set of tracks that
belong to different genres and were preferred by it over the entire
period analyzed.
Nonetheless, we have retained a significant number of exclusive
tracks for each city that are potentially capable of revealing the
patterns of interest. More specifically, the number of tracks in the
backbone for each city has decreased from 700–900 to 340–570.
We found that most of the removed tracks belonged to very popular genres in Brazil, such as *sertanejo* and *funk*, including their
sub-genres (e.g. *agronejo*, *funk-mtg* ). These genres accounted for
about 45% and 10% of the removed tracks for each city, respectively.
Another frequently removed genre was *arrocha*, which accounted
for 10% of the removed tracks.

After this, for each city *𝑐* *𝑖* and each track in its respective set
*𝑆* *𝑐* *𝑖*, we gathered the values of the track acoustic features explained
in Section 3, such as acousticness, valence, danceability, etc. From
the distribution of values for each acoustic feature in the set *𝑆* *𝑐* *𝑖* of
city *𝑐* *𝑖*, we extracted the four moments: *mean*, *variance*, *skewness*,
and *kurtosis* . The intuition behind extracting these moments is to
capture different aspects of the distribution of acoustic features
for each city beyond the mean, allowing to obtain more consistent
clusters [ 18, 35 ]. With this, we obtained a final feature matrix of 17
Cities x 28 features (7 acoustic features x 4 moments). By analyzing
this matrix, we expected to identify regional and cultural patterns
in track preferences, providing a detailed view of the predominant
acoustic characteristics in cities aggregated by region.
To cluster the cities according to the audio characteristics of their
preferred tracks, we started by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the final matrix of 17 Cities x 28 features (7 acoustic
features x 4 moments) [ 18 ]. PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the explained variance

[ 23 ]. Ultimately, we adopted 5 principal components, which corresponded to 82% of the explained variance. With the reduced data
matrix, we then used the K-means clustering algorithm to group the
cities based on the acoustic characteristics of their preferred tracks

[ 18, 19 ]. Additionally, we used the silhouette index to determine
the optimal number of clusters *𝑘*, which was found to be *𝑘* = 6,
with a value of 0.38 indicating fair clustering [38].
Finally, we characterized each cluster based on the most popular
genres and the track acoustic features. This alignment addresses
**RQ2** : the first aspect illustrates the favorite genres of a group of
cities, while the second aspect reveals the similarities in the track
acoustic features between these clusters. However, clusters may
exhibit statistically equivalent average acoustic properties. To distinguish statistically significant differences, we employed a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) [21, 44].
### **5 RESULTS**

This section presents our results. First, we present a topological
characterization of the networks modeled. Then we present the
results for our RQ1 and finally for RQ2.

### **5.1 Topological analysis of genre preference** **networks**

As described in Section 4, we extracted the backbone for all instances of B [∆] *[𝜏]* with a *p-value <* 0 *.* 05 to determine the preferred
genres of each city. Networks were grouped by year and the average
and standard deviation for some metrics are displayed in Table 1 of
six networks per year. On average, the backbone retained about 25%
of the nodes and 11% of the edges. This significant reduction in network size allows us to focus on the most salient genre preferences
for each city, as shown in Figure 1.

**Table 1: Topology of the original and backbone networks for**
**all instances of** B [∆] *[𝜏]* **in 2022 and 2023.**

We observe the number of nodes and averaged metrics in the
bimonthly original networks is quite similar between the two years,
with 118±6.6 in 2022 and 112±20.7 in 2023. There is a significant
decrease in the backbone networks, with an average of 25.6±2.6
nodes in 2022 and 28.3±4.2 nodes in 2023. The average number
of edges also decreased from 1422±176.8 and 1211.5±203.7 in the
original networks to 161.8±12.7 and 154.5±23.3 in the backbone
networks for 2022 and 2023, respectively. The average in-degree
( *𝑘* [ˆ] *𝑖𝑛* ) for *𝑉* *𝐶𝑖𝑡𝑦* (cities) decreased from 76.8±12.8 and 63.8±12.7 in
the original networks to 9.4±3.4 and 8.9±3.3 in the backbone networks, respectively. Similarly, the average out-degree ( *𝑘* [ˆ] *𝑜𝑢𝑡* ) for
*𝑉* *𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑟𝑒* (genres) decreased from 11.3±6.4 and 9.9±6.6 to 6.19±6.18
and 5.4±5.8, respectively. The significant reduction in the number of
nodes and edges in the backbone networks emphasises the sparsity
and more focused nature of the backbone, which is essential for
identifying the most relevant genre preferences for each city.

### **5.2 Analysis of musical genre preferences**

We then move on to analyze the distributed preference of genres
in the backbone via the Gini index to determine whether cities

listen to their favorite genres with similar intensity in the months
analyzed. Figure 4 shows these results in the form of a heatmap. In
this heatmap, the *𝑥* -axis represents the different cities and the *𝑦* -axis
represents the bimonthly time windows from January/February
2022 to November/December 2023. Each cell in the heatmap shows
the Gini index for a specific city and time window, with the color
intensity indicating the degree of inequality in genre preferences.
The Gini index values range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 0
indicating a more even distribution of genre preferences and values
closer to 1 indicating a more uneven distribution.
The Gini index values for cities are mostly between 0.1 and 0.4,
suggesting overall balanced genre preferences. However, this balance could mask nuances in the distribution. For example, a Gini
index of 0.1 could mean that there are two sets of genres that are
very popular, while others are leveled down. The heatmap allows


We also note that although most cities listened more than 150
unique genres, only a maximum of 30 were considered urban preferences in the two years. To illustrate these topological patterns of
revealed genre preferences, we show in Figures 2 and 3 the original
network view for our first bipartite network corresponding to the
period January/February 2022. The darker the edge, the stronger
the preference of this genre for the connected city. If we follow our
hypothesis that such genres are maintained and reinforced in the
network behavior, we see that out of the 142 genres in the original network, only 17 remain in the backbone network, indicating
that each city has a limited number of genres that are consistently
preferred over time.

us to observe patterns and changes in the distribution of genre
preferences over time and in different cities. From the heatmap, we
can see that certain cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Manaus and Belém
have relatively higher Gini index values, indicating a more unequal
distribution of genre preferences in some time windows. On the
other hand, cities such as Cuiabá, Campo Grande and Uberlândia
show more balanced genre preferences with lower Gini index values throughout the analyzed period. We thus observe sometimes
consistency, sometimes variation in genre preferences between different cities and time windows, which helps us to understand the
distribution of music tastes in the Brazilian cities analyzed.
We analyzed the persistence of genres in the backbone over time,
aiming to identify whether cities listen to the same genres with

consistent intensity, as shown in Figure 5. In this heatmap, the
*x-axis* represent the cities and the *y-axis* represent the compared
bimonthly time windows Δ *𝜏* and Δ *𝜏* +1 . Each cell shows the percentage of genres from Δ *𝜏* that are still present in Δ *𝜏* +1 for each city. This
persistence analysis revealed two main findings. First, all cities have
a well-defined group of preferred genres, indicated by a high persistence degree. Second, certain months showed significant changes
in genre preferences compared to the previous months in most
cities, except for Cuiabá, Campo Grande, and Uberlândia. These
months are January/February, March/April, September/October,
and November/December, which correspond to popular holidays
in Brazil. January/February and March/April coincide with the
carnival period, characterized by nationwide parties and specific
music genres. September/October and November/December are
the last four months of the year, associated with Christmas and
New Year’s Eve celebrations. These holidays could increase the
popularity of certain genres or change the acoustic characteristics
of genres during these periods.
Although we found seasonal differences, we did not formally
establish a causal connection between the genres in these seasonal
windows and the acoustic features, but a potential link could exist.
Based on these findings, we divided the cities into two groups: those
that consistently listen to the same genres over the years and those
with seasonal variations. Cuiabá, Campo Grande, and Uberlândia
stand out as cities with no significant changes in both years. These
cities are geographically close, but other geographically close cities,
such as São Paulo, Campinas, and Belo Horizonte, do not exhibit
the same behavior. Besides Cuiabá, Campo Grande, and Uberlândia,
all other cities show seasonal variances, mostly between 10% and
30% in different genres. Overall, the favorite genres of each city
vary very little, indicating that the preferences are stable with some
seasonal influences.
To summarize, preferences for music genres in Brazilian cities
show a stable set of preferred genres, with backbone networks
highlighting the most important ones. The Gini index indicates
balanced preferences, while persistence analysis reveals minimal
changes over time, except during major holidays. Overall, genre
preferences remain consistent, with cultural events contributing to
occasional variations.

### **5.3 Analysis of track acoustic features and** **regional patterns**

In our RQ2, we wanted to understand to what extent the intrinsic
acoustic features of tracks are independent of their musical genre
and whether there are acoustic differences between different regions within the same musical genre. As explained in Section 4, we
applied K-means clustering and used the average silhouette score
to evaluate the quality of the resulting clusters on track acoustic
features, uncovering 6 clusters composed of the following cities:

  - **Cluster 1:** Florianópolis, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, and Belo

Horizonte

  - **Cluster 2:** Goiânia, Brasília, and Uberlândia

  - **Cluster 3:** Recife, Fortaleza, and Salvador

  - **Cluster 4:** Rio de Janeiro, Belém, and Manaus

  - **Cluster 5:** Cuiabá and Campo Grande

  - **Cluster 6:** São Paulo and Campinas


We start by presenting in Figure 6 the geographic distribution
of each cluster in the Brazilian territory. Geographically, we can
characterize Cluster 1 as the Southern of Brazil, with the addition
of Belo Horizonte. This is a distinctive pattern since Belo Horizonte is in the Southeast but clusters with Southern cities. Cluster 2

likely represents the Central region, including part of the Midwest
and the city of Uberlândia, bridging the Midwest and Southeast.
Cluster 3, consisting of Recife, Fortaleza, and Salvador, aligns well
with expectations as these are Northeastern cities, showing regional acoustic similarities. Cluster 4 contains Rio de Janeiro along
with Belém and Manaus, indicating a notable divergence as Rio de
Janeiro typically aligns with Southeastern cities. This cluster suggests that geographic distance was not a barrier to grouping these
cities acoustically. Cluster 5 represents part of Brazil’s Midwest
with Cuiabá and Campo Grande, reflecting acoustic similarities
within this region. Finally, Cluster 6 includes São Paulo and Campinas, suggesting that these two cities from the state of São Paulo
have unique acoustic features that set them apart from other Southeastern cities, further emphasizing the distinctiveness within the
Southeast region itself. These clusters reveal both expected and
unexpected patterns, illustrating the complex regional and cultural
variations in the acoustic features of tracks across Brazilian cities.

We move to our analysis of the exclusive tracks in each cluster,
resulting in the classification of the genre preferences, as shown in
Figure 7. The heatmap illustrates the distribution of genre preferences across different clusters. The *𝑥* -axis represents the clusters,
while the *𝑦* -axis represents the genres. Each cell shows the percentage of tracks in the cluster that belong to a particular genre. For
visualization purposes, we selected genres for the heatmap where
the sum of all cells in a given row (genre) is at least 10% of what is
listened to in the clusters. This threshold provided a good trade-off
between highlighting the most popular genres of the clusters and
including the sub-genres of these top genres. A higher threshold
would have resulted in only the top genres being displayed, obscuring sub-genres, while a lower threshold would have displayed less
popular genres, complicating visualization and interpretation.
We found that Clusters 2 and 5 share similar genre preferences,
focused on *sertanejo* and related styles. Similarly, Cluster 1 and
Cluster 6 both prefer *funk* and its sub-genres. Although these clusters are geographically close, they suggest track acoustic features

differences within the same group of genres. In contrast, Cluster 3
and Cluster 4 did not show significant similarities with any other
cluster, despite their proximity to each other. Cluster 3 strongly
prefers *forró* and *arrocha*, while Cluster 4 has a more general genre
preference.
Given the identified genre patterns, we analyzed significant differences in track acoustic features between clusters with similar

genre preferences. We used one-way ANOVA with a *p-value* of 0.05
to identify differences. This analysis revealed significant differences
in 9 of 13 track acoustic features between at least two clusters. We
used the average of these features to profile and compare clusters
with similar genre preferences, as shown in Figure 8.
In these radar plots, each axis represents one of the acoustic
features (e.g., acousticness, valence, danceability). The values on
the axes indicate the average feature value for each cluster. The

first plot compares Cluster 2 (Goiânia, Brasília, and Uberlândia)
and Cluster 5 (Cuiabá and Campo Grande), which have preferences
for *sertanejo* and related styles. The notable difference is in *live-*
*ness*, while other features are relatively similar. Both clusters show
high *energy*, indicating a preference for energetic national country
music. The second plot compares Cluster 1 (Florianópolis, Porto
Alegre, Curitiba, and Belo Horizonte) and Cluster 6 (São Paulo
and Campinas), which are associated with *funk* and its sub-genres.
The main differences are in *speechiness*, *acousticness*, and *energy* .
However, *danceability* stands out as a core feature for *funk* across
both clusters. Finally, the third plot compares Cluster 3 (Recife,
Fortaleza, and Salvador) and Cluster 4 (Rio de Janeiro, Belém, and
Manaus), which do not share common genre preferences. Cluster 3
has higher values for most features than Cluster 4, but both clusters
characterize their regions — the North with Rio de Janeiro and the
Northeast — as very energetic and dance-oriented.
Lastly, we deeply explored the distribution of the outstanding
track acoustic features of each comparison made in Figure 8, as
shown in Figure 9. These boxplots provide a detailed view of the
distribution for *liveness*, *speechiness*, and *valence* in all clusters. The
first plot illustrates the *liveness* feature for all clusters. Clusters
2 (Goiânia, Brasília, and Uberlândia) and 5 (Cuiabá and Campo
Grande), which share similar *sertanejo* preferences, contrast significantly with the other clusters. This suggests that *sertanejo* tracks
are more associated with live performances compared to other genres. The second plot presents the *speechiness* feature. Clusters 1
(Florianópolis, Porto Alegre, Curitiba and Belo Horizonte) and 6
(São Paulo and Campinas), the *funk* clusters, show a higher lyrical
presence in their favorite tracks. This suggests that these clusters
value lyrical content more and differentiate the types of *funk* they
prefer. The *funk* of Cluster 1 ( *mtg, bh, carioca* ) focuses on rhythm
and energy, while Cluster 6 emphasizes a more lyrical funk ( *paulista,*
*consciente* ). The third plot shows the *valence* feature. Cluster 4 (Rio
de Janeiro, Belém, and Manaus) shows a more dispersed distribution, indicating a preference for more “negative” music compared
to the other clusters.
To summarise, the Brazilian city clusters show different acoustic
patterns in the tracks, regardless of the musical genres. Significant
differences were observed in features such as *liveness*, *speechiness*,
and *valence* between clusters with similar genre preferences. This
reveals regional and cultural differences in musical preferences and
acoustic nuances within the same genres in different regions.

the period from 2022 to 2023. This analysis aimed to understand
the regional and cultural patterns in musical preferences and how
these preferences are reflected in both genre and acoustic characteristics. Our approach involved modeling bipartite networks of
genres and cities, extracting their backbones to highlight significant
preferences, and performing detailed temporal and cluster analyses.
The primary objectives were to address two research questions.
In response to RQ1, we discovered that each city has a well-defined
set of favorite genres that remain relatively stable over time. These
favorite genres are consistently preferred, but there are occasional
seasonal variations influenced by major holidays like Christmas,
New Year’s Eve, and Carnival. It follows the results of previous
studies which shows Brazil as one of the countries that most listen

to national genres and how diverse their preference can be over
different regions [ 6, 25, 30 ]. Our analysis has shown that the cities
can be divided into two groups: one group, which includes Cuiabá,
Campo Grande, and Uberlândia, consume their strict favorite genres
throughout the year, while the other group has seasonal preferences
in addition to their favorite genres. This distinction sheds light on
how cultural events influence musical tastes in different regions of
Brazil.

Regarding RQ2, our clustering based on track acoustic features
revealed distinct regional patterns. We identified six clusters of
cities, some of which showed strong geographical ties, while others,
such as the cluster including Rio de Janeiro, Belém, and Manaus,
demonstrated that geographical distance was not a barrier to similar
acoustic preferences, even their genre consumption are significantly
different, as shown by previous authors [ 25, 30, 45 ]. Notably, we
found that clusters with similar genre preferences could exhibit
significant acoustic differences. For example, Cluster 5 (Cuiabá
and Campo Grande) and Cluster 2 (Goiânia, Brasília, and Uberlândia) both prefer *sertanejo*, but with different acoustic profiles.
This suggests that even within the same genre, there are regional
differences in acoustic preferences that reflect broader cultural and
regional influences. Our results show the importance of considering
both genre and acoustic features to understand regional musical
preferences. These findings can be valuable for the development
of targeted marketing strategies and the improvement of music
recommendation systems.
For future work, we plan to scale the analysis to a global level
to gain even deeper insights into the cultural and regional diversity of musical preferences and to use the backbone extraction
methodology to cope with the heterogeneity of global music data.


In this study, we collected and analyzed data on digital music consumption from Spotify, focusing on various cities in Brazil over
