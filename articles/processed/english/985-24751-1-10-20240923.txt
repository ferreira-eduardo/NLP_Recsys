### **ABSTRACT**

The constant progress of technology, especially in the area of health,
brings numerous benefits, one of which is the increase in human
life expectancy. However, problems that occur recurrently among
the elderly age group are now on the radar of studies that also seek
to improve the quality of life of these people. The number of cases
of falls among elderly people is worrying, even more so as this is a
portion of the population that tends to live alone. In the context of
smart homes, several solutions have emerged for monitoring elderly
people to increase safety and provide faster assistance, if necessary.
One of these solutions is the use of wearable devices responsible for
identifying the person’s movements. This work presents the study
and development of a wearable device capable of detecting falls and,
if they occur, automatically notifying the necessary people through
alert messages via the Telegram application so that they can help
the person who has suffered a fall. In this work, a Wi-Fi network,
MQTT protocol, accelerometer and gyroscope inertial sensors and
an ESP32 board programmed using the Arduino IDE were used.
Preliminary tests indicated good performance in recognizing falls,
based on tilt angle analysis, gyroscope readings and accelerometer
readings. The proof of concept and preliminary tests carried out
demonstrate the potential for using low-cost technologies for wearable resources for application in smart homes and monitoring the
health of elderly people.

### **1 INTRODUCTION**

With the encouragement of innovation and technology as an important pillar to improve people’s quality of life, there is also an
increase in life expectancy and the aging rate of the world’s population. In Brazil, according to the 2022 IBGE census, the population
over 60 years of age reached 32,113,490 (15.6%) [ 9 ]. The best thermometer to measure an elderly person’s health is checking their
functional capacity, which is a person’s real ability to carry out the

daily activities possible to live independently and self-sufficiently,
which tends to reduce with aging. There are scales that measure
this functional capacity, such as the Barthel scale, the Katz scale,
the Lawton and Brody scale, the Pfeffer scale, among others [ 12 ],
which assess the independence of the elderly in basic activities of
daily living: eating, personal hygiene, getting dressed, using the
toilet, moving from bed to chair and vice versa, cooking, managing
medications, shopping, washing clothes, cleaning the house, using
the telephone, remembering appointments, among others. Risks
such as falling further increase the concern of family members and
people close to elderly people, as they reduce functional capacity

[28].
A smart home has devices connected to the Internet that allow

remote monitoring and control of appliances and systems such as
lighting and heating, as well as other types of sensors, using the
internet of things (IoT)[ 13 ]. Furthermore, there may be wearable
sensors that allow the implementation of *Human Activity Recogni-*
*tion (HAR)* systems in smart homes, helping to improve people’s
quality of life with autonomy and safety [ 7 ], [ 23 ]. In this context,
a solution to alleviate the consequences of these difficulties in the
lives of elderly people, while rescuing independence in daily activities and reassuring people close to them, consists of installing
monitoring systems in the home, in order to guarantee assistance
if an incident occurs such as: a fire, fainting, fall or even illness
caused by changes in vital signs. There are different types of emergency alert devices that have been developed for dependent people,
including children, people with disabilities, the sick and the elderly.
Most of them send an alarm only when help is needed, but some
are developed to monitor the health of sick patients, such as blood
pressure, heart rate, among others [ 17 ]. Monitoring an environment means using different devices that obtain desired data, such
as a camera, motion sensor, temperature, humidity or brightness,
among others, so that from this data it is possible to make decisions
in order to achieve the objectives of monitoring.
The problem addressed in this work is how to identify that an
elderly person who is alone in their home has suffered a fall and, in
addition to identifying, use this information to alert people nearby
through warning messages [ 11 ]. Therefore, an effective, portable
solution is sought, with integration with the internet network, to
maintain connectivity and provide warnings when necessary. One
of the ways to monitor situations that happen to human beings is by
"wearing" sensors and devices capable of identifying variations and

communicating important information in such a way that readings
and data collection are not harmed and are useful for the necessary
analysis.
The main objective of this work is the design and implementation of a wearable device prototype for fall monitoring, using
accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, and connecting this monitoring devices to a smart home ecosystem using the Node-RED
platform to manage warnings when a fall has been detected. To
achieve this objective, it was necessary to research and understand
the technologies involved in existing wearable devices and, from
this, choose the best and most affordable ones to implement in a
real prototype. Then, an accelerometer and a gyroscope were integrated with the ESP32 module to build the wearable device. Finally,
software was developed in a smart home environment capable of
reliably collecting sensor data and interpreting it to identify different movements that determine a fall and manage alerts sent over
the internet to registered people.
Section 2 presents the references about elderly falls and domestic
accidents, wearable devices, Node-RED and related work. Section
3 describes the methodology adopted to build the prototype and
defines the test cases studied, as well as the standard followed to
carry out these tests. Section 4 presents all the results obtained
with the developed solution and, finally, Section 5 deals with the
conclusions about the prototype and implemented solution and
indicates development opportunities to improve the project.
### **2 THEORICAL REFERENCE** **2.1 Elderly falls and domestic accidents**

A fall is defined as *"inadvertently coming to rest on the ground or*
*at another lower level, excluding intentional changes of position to*
*lean on furniture, walls or other objects"* [ 16 ]. As this is an increasingly present problem in the lives of families around the world, the
World Health Organization (WHO), which defines the age group of
elderly people as 60 years or older, publishes global reports aimed
at preventing falls in old age. The frequency of falls increases with
age and level of frailty. Approximately 28% to 35% of people over
65 years of age suffer falls each year, and the proportion rises from
32% to 42% for people over 70 years of age [16].
Falls can occur due to factors such as: decreased muscle strength;
osteoporosis; walking abnormalities; change in blood pressure; depression; senility; osteoarthritis, hip fragility or balance changes;
neurological changes (stroke, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease); decreased vision and/or hearing;
among others. There are also factors related to the environment
such as: poorly lit environments; poorly planned houses; inadequate arrangement of furniture that hinders movement; slippery
objects scattered around the house; among others [5].
Furthermore, a higher frequency of falls has been reported in
nursing homes, in some cases including recurrent falls. It is possible to conclude, then, that even if nursing homes are adapted to
the reality of the elderly’s tasks, they are still not out of danger.
Therefore, the implementation of integrated solutions for these
people’s homes is increasingly being studied so that assistance can
be provided quickly if falls occur, such as the development of intelligent surveillance systems for monitoring, since the medical


consequences of accidents like this depend on much of the rescue
response time [18].
### **2.2 Wearable devices**

Wearable devices are technologies developed to be used directly
in contact with the body, whether as sensors embedded in clothing, as accessories to wear on the head, badges or even as wrist
accessories. Several brands already have so-called “smartwatches”,
which are watches with the functions of well-known smartphones
and which increasingly have applications that are interesting for
monitoring the health of the individual who uses them. There are
“smartwhatches” which are capable of measuring body temperature, blood glucose or oxygen concentration, blood pH and blood
pressure through biometric sensors [24].
The benefits of this type of technology are very interesting from
the point of view of people’s quality of life, especially the elderly
population.
In the specific case of fall detection, as discussed in [ 1 ], there is
also a study on the best location for the wearable device considering
two main factors: the accuracy of the sensors and the need to be
comfortable for the person using it. Among the places available to
attach them, there are waist, head, wrist, front of the waist, thigh,
chest, ankle and arm. According to [ 8 ] and [ 1 ], the best places to
guarantee correct analysis of sensor data are the chest, ankle and
waist, however these are strongly linked to the stigma of using a
medical device and, combined with the fact needing to be used 24
hours a day, they can be uncomfortable and less accepted [8].
The most comfortable place from the user’s point of view is
the wrist, however solutions based on wearable devices attached
to the wrist have the worst accuracy results, with values lower
than 90%, greatly increasing the level of complexity of the analysis
and calculations involving the data obtained. For devices used in
this location, a more in-depth study on the use of this data ends
up being necessary. Some studies include, for example, machine
learning applications as a resource to increase the precision and
quality of analyzes [8].
Accelerometers and gyroscopes are inertial sensors used to monitor movements that can be attached as wearables [ 26 ]. The accelerometer measures the acceleration of a body in relation to gravity, that is, it measures the acceleration exerted on certain objects,
performing some type of action depending on the movement performed on it. The gyroscope uses the force of gravity to indicate the
position of a given object in space, being able to identify whether
something is rotating on its own axis or whether it is pointing
up or down. When the objective is to accurately determine the
movement of an object or user, it may be necessary to combine
the signals from sensors accelerometers and gyroscopes, because
accelerometers present as an output signal the linear acceleration
of the object and gyroscopes the angular velocity. The combination
of these signals results in more complete information about the
movement and allows for more assertive analysis.
### **2.3 Node-RED**

In order to connect and implement IoT devices, it is possible to find
some tools that facilitate activities at the code and programming
levels. Node-Red is a programming tool, created by IBM Emerging

Technology, based on flow, used to integrate electronic components
with applications of different natures, making it possible to develop
programs quickly and intuitively. It is open source and is based
on *nodes*, blocks of pre-defined functions available in a platform
tab called *palette* . It is possible to build the desired flow just by
dragging the blocks to the provided workspace and making the
desired connections and interactions between blocks [21].
To make it possible to assess whether the constructed flow is
performing the functions as determined, the platform also has a
“debug" tab, where messages and actions appear synchronously
with the functioning of the developed system. Node-RED has been
used in the scenario of developing IoT and connectivity solutions
as it proves to be a very useful and practical platform [3].
### **2.4 Related works**

Gupta et al. [ 14 ] presents an IoT-based fall detection monitoring
system for the elderly using only a 3-axis accelerometer. Torres [ 26 ]
uses two sensors (accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope), attached
to the user’s chest. A threshold analysis algorithm uses the data
generated by these sensors to detect falls. This approach is the same
as that used in this work. However, in the work of [ 26 ] Node-Red
was not used as a tool to integrate devices with the network and a
smart home system.
Quadros et al. [ 8 ] show the development and evaluation of a fall
detection solution with the implementation of machine learning to
improve results. The developed solution is worn on the wrist, as it
is considered the most comfortable place, and uses an accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer to calculate acceleration, speed
and displacement which, implemented in methods based on machine learning, can define the best approach for detecting a fall.
The results are based on data acquired from falling and non-falling
movements of 22 volunteers demonstrating the approach used for
testing with real users. The authors of [ 20 ] applied the methodology, focusing on precision and effectiveness, to evaluate the KNN,
Decision Tree and MLP algorithms applied to accelerometer data to
detect falls. Other works also applied machine learning algorithms
and [2] and deep learning [4], [15] and [19].
The works of [ 18 ] and [ 27 ] make a comprehensive survey of
different devices, fall detection systems and the algorithms implemented in each one. Three categories of approaches are identified:
solutions based on wearable devices, devices placed in the environment and solutions using cameras. The analysis on wearable
devices deals with the same sensors used in this work and the approach is very close considering algorithms and location of the
wearable device. The analyzes of other approaches are interesting,
as they demonstrate alternatives that, if linked to wearable devices,
add even more reliability to monitoring in smart homes, especially
in the problem of elderly people falling.
In the work of [ 25 ], wearable devices based on inertial sensors
and insoles that were developed for applications related to falls
are analyzed, identifying key points, including spatio-temporal
parameters, biomechanical parameters of gait, physical activities
and methods data analysis relating to developed systems.
The assessment of confidence in the functioning of a ubiquitous
system that uses a microphone and accelerometer and magnetometer sensors to detect and alert falls called fAlert is presented in the


works [ 10 ] and [ 11 ]. Software quality measures such as precision,
sensitivity, availability, specificity, performance, accuracy, among
others, are used.
This work presents a wearable device (on the chest) that collects
and analyzes movement data from elderly people wherever they
are in a smart home ecosystem. An alert is sent to the responsible
personnel in real time via Telegram in a cell phone, speeding up
the rescue process.
### **3 METHODOLOGY**

The wearable device for monitoring falls proposed in this work is
based on two sensors, the accelerometer and the gyroscope, to find
movement patterns that determine a fall and then alert family members of elderly people. The MPU6050 module was chosen because it
has the two sensors mentioned integrated in order to facilitate the
use of its output data when carrying out the tests. This module was
connected to the ESP32 development module, which has a small
size and built-in support for WiFi and Bluetooth networks, as well
as integrated flash memory.
To develop the project’s programming, the integrated development environment created to program microcontrollers from the
Arduino family (Arduino IDE) was used, but which can also be used
for compatible modules, such as the ESP32. The IDE’s programming language is C++, with the installation of specific libraries
that already have ready-made functions for reading and processing sensor data, in addition to libraries that assist in the use of
the ESP32 module’s WiFi connectivity (WiFi, Ethernet, Wire and
PubSubClient).
### **3.1 Construction of the wearable device**

The construction of the prototype began with the assembly of the
components on a bench to carry out basic functional tests, with
the sole objective of reading sensor data in a satisfactory manner,
implementing communication with other clients using the MQTT
protocol ( *Message Queue Telemetry Transport* ) and implement the
complementary filter in order to increase data reliability [ 26 ]. Figure
1 depicts the arrangement of the prototype components in the first
stage of construction without considering sensor reading axes.

To build the wearable device prototype, the chest was considered as the best place to attach the components, aiming for more
reliable data and better performance. Based on this determination,

a comfortable and safe way to use the device was sought, as shown
in Figure 2. The ESP32 is powered at this stage by a 9V battery.
### **3.2 Algorithm**

The algorithm implemented in Arduino IDE for the ESP32 module is
schematized in the flowchart in Figure 3. ESP32 stablish connection
with Wi-fi to access the MQTT broker and activate the MPU6050
module composed by accelerometer and gyroscope. ESP32 remains
in a loop taking sensor readings, converting values of gyroscope
to degrees/second and accelerometer to degrees. After that, the
complementary filter is used. The results are analyzed to identify
falls and the alerts are sent.
### **3.3 Test Cases**

Considering the age range of the elderly, it is possible to identify
some scenarios that could result in a fall: falls when walking or
standing, falls when standing on supports (e.g. stairs, benches, etc.),
falls when lying down or getting out of bed or falling when sitting
on a chair [ 18 ]. Therefore, to carry out the tests, three non-falling
movements and four falling movements were determined for analysis. The non-falling movements are walking, standing and sitting,
and the falling movements are forwards, backwards and to the left
and right sides. Movement variations occur based on the initialization and stationary values of the MPU6050 module sensors. In
this way, the device is always initialized in the sitting position in
order to reproduce a scenario where the user puts on the device in
the morning before getting up, thus maintaining value references
with the smallest possible variations and improving results. Other
voluntary movements of lying down are considered normal and do
not generate alerts.
### **3.4 Testing methodology**

To carry out tests, the following methodology was defined:

(1) The person responsible for using the wearable device prototype must place it on the body, adjusting the straps so that
it is coupled and fixed to the chest, but still in a comfortable
way that does not impede movement. The device must be
turned off.


**Figure 3: Flowchart of the program developed for ESP32.**

Source: From author (2024).

(2) Once adjusted and dressed properly, the user must sit in a
chair with an upright posture and turn on the device.
(3) All tests must last two minutes to better visualize the plotted
data and be carried out in a location with a stable Wi-Fi

connection and by the same user.
(4) For non-fall tests, data can be collected as soon as the device
is turned on, however for fall data the user must get up and
go to the testing location and wait at least thirty seconds until
the data is collected and stabilized for better visualization in

graphs that are plotted simultaneously.
(5) After carrying out the falling movement, wait again for at
least thirty seconds for the data to stabilize.
(6) At the end of the desired data collection, the user must turn
off the device so that the data plotting stops and the graphs
can be saved with the recent data.

(7) Ideally, the tests should be repeated three to four times for
data comparison and coherence.
### **4 RESULTS**

Obtaining the results begins with reading the data from the MPU6050
module. The raw values read by the sensors can be obtained using the Wire library, however it is necessary to process these data,
as the values found do not correspond to any physical quantity

and therefore it is necessary to convert them. In the case of the
gyroscope, the values are converted to degrees per second (º/s) and
represent the position variations in an angular velocity quantity.
As for the accelerometer, the raw data is used to find an inclination
angle, but for the result of the values obtained to be a more accurate
value, it is necessary to use a relationship between the three axes,
making a conversion according to equations (1) to (3) implemented
in the code.

values (sitting, standing and walking) and are demonstrated in
Figures 4 and 5. In Figure 4, it can be seen that the tilt angle in the
Y axis increases, while in the X axis it decreases when the person
stands up, but in the Z axis the change is small due to the position of
the body where the wearable is located. The person leans forward
to stand, so the values of X and Y vary more. These variations are
visualized in the gyroscope and accelerometer readings. When the
person is walking (Figure 5), the variations in the X and Y readings
are greater, as the person varies the position of their body.
Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9 present data on falling movements (forward,
backward, right side and left side).
In all plotted graphs, the X axis presents the last two minutes of
sensor readings in HH:MM format. The Y axis for the “Accelerometer Readings" graph presents the angle variations in degrees, for
the “Gyroscope Readings" graph it presents the angular velocity in
degrees per second (º/s) and, for the “ Tilt angle" the Y axis presents
the angles in degrees. The values presented were analyzed to verify coherence and are samples chosen from four others for each

movement.

It is possible to infer from the graphs generated that non-falling
movements will not be confused with falling movements, since
the values obtained for angular velocity for both the movement
of getting up from a chair and movements for walking are not
greater than 80 or less than -40, whereas for falling movements the
values obtained from the gyroscope reading exceed these limits. The
angular velocity is very important for determining the limits, as the
speed of falling movements is clearly greater than that of everyday
movements. It was expected that in the accelerometer readings the
Z axis and the Y axis would present greater variation in degrees for
forward and backward falling movements, since these movements
occur by rotating the axes around the X axis. The falling movements
to the right and left sides, the X and Y axes are those that show the
greatest variations, as the movements occur by rotating the axes
around the Z axis. Finally, the inclination angle values, mainly on
the Y axis, are also very specific and clearly incorporate the critical
components of the accelerometer and gyroscope.
After analyzing and identifying limits for each component of the
tests: accelerometer, gyroscope and tilt angle readings, these limits
are implemented in conditional structures in the code to ensure
that all cases are understood. Each case of an outage is published
in a single topic called “ Outage " and this topic must be accessed on
Node-RED, where messages are sent to the people registered for
this purpose.
With the implementation of all cases of failure in the developed
algorithm, integration with Node-RED can be carried out. A flow
was built with a node subscribed to the topic “ Queda " which, upon
receiving the value “ 1 " indicating that there was a fall, activates a
trigger that sends a message through the Telegram application. To
implement the sending of messages via Node-RED, it is necessary
to create a chat bot on Telegram, that is, a specific programmed
conversation window for sending outage alert messages. The creation of the chat bot can be easily done through the application
itself by chatting with another bot developed for this purpose. It
is necessary to search for “ BotFather " within the Telegram application and send the “ newbot " command. With this, it is possible
choose the bot’s name and username, but the username must be

In the equations *𝜌* represents the rotation around the Y axis, *𝜙*
the rotation around the X axis and *𝜃* the rotation around the Z
axis, “arctan" refers to finding the arc tangent, the inverse function
of the tangent, and the values *𝐴* *𝑥*, *𝐴* *𝑦* and *𝐴* *𝑧* represent the readings obtained with the MPU-6050 module on the X, Y and Z axes,
respectively.
After the sensor data reading provides treated values with known
units, the implementation of the complementary filter is included
with the function of reducing noise in the measurements by integrating gyroscope data with the angles obtained from the accelerometer
readings. The complementary filter uses two constants in the calculations, *𝛼* (alpha) and Δ t (sampling rate). *𝛼* is determined by a
relationship between a time constant and the sampling rate. For the
calculations in this article, a time constant equal to 1 and a sampling
rate of 0.04 are used, values obtained through the specifications of
the chosen sensor module, resulting in an alpha value equal to 0.96.
In this way, the filtered angle is found through the equation (4).

*𝐴𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒* = *𝛼* ∗( *𝐴𝑛𝑔𝐺𝑖𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑝𝑦* ) + (1 − *𝛼* ) ∗( *𝐴𝑛𝑔𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟* ) (4)

With all readings occurring correctly, the aim is to develop the
fall detection algorithm based on values obtained for previously
determined falling and non-falling movements.
A dashboard was developed using the Node-RED platform capable of synchronously plotting the values obtained with the device.
Data readings are published in topics and in the flow built in NodeRED, these topics are subscribed to nodes called “ mqtt in ", this
is possible because both the ESP32 development module and the
node are connected to the same broker, according to server and
client concepts, using the MQTT protocol. These nodes responsible
for receiving the reading values are connected to “ chart " nodes
capable of plotting graphs on the dashboard. This way the data is
posted at the same time as the readings take place. The constructed
flow is demonstrated in Figure 10, where subscription nodes in the
topics where sensor values are posted in Node-RED.
From the built dashboard it is possible to monitor the values
of the desired readings for subsequent analysis and definition of
limits for each type of fall determined. The graphs present the tests
following the methodology described previously, first for non-fall

unique. For this work, a bot named “ Monitoramento e saúde "
with username “monitoramento-saudebot" was created.
When creating a bot with “ BotFather " a token code is provided
to access the HTTP API. Node-RED has an extension that directly accesses Telegram named “ telegrambot ", generating five new nodes.


One of these is the “ sender " node responsible for sending a message to the registered chat when activated. To execute the sending
action, a “ mqtt in " node is used to receive the message posted by
ESP32 when a fall movement occurs and this event is enough to
start the flow.

One message that will be sent with each fall alert can also be
configured using nodes in Node-RED. The fall alert message is written in the “ funcion " block and connected to the “ mqtt in " block
with the chatID number specific to the destination Telegram. The
chatId is provided by the Telegram application searching for “ Get


My ID " in the search field of the Telegram application itself and
after starting the conversation, the number will be provided automatically. The “ sender " node must be filled in with the chatId
provided and the message configured to indicate which chat bot
the message is intended for.

### **5 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS**


**Figure 10: Subscription nodes in the topics where sensor**
**values are posted.**

For the person interested in monitoring falls to receive messages
via Telegram on their cell phone, they must search for the name
of the chat bot in the application’s search field and start the conversation, which corresponds to sending a “ start " command to
the bot. An introduction message is also configured for when a
person signs up for the conversation. Using the “ receiver " node,
it is possible to trigger a new process when a message is received
by the chat bot. From the “ start " received, a trigger is activated
that sends an introduction message. The settings are the same as
the fall alert flow. The constructed flows are represented in Figure
11. The message sent by Node-RED to Telegram from the person
responsible translate from Portuguese to English is:
"Hello! I’m Mr. José’s falls monitoring assistant.
I’m here to warn you if an accident happens.
WARNING: Mr. José may have suffered a fall. Try to
get in touch as soon as possible".

The main problem addressed in this work is how to identify that an
elderly person who is alone in their home has suffered a fall. When
identifying that there has been a fall, it is necessary to alert people
nearby through warning messages.
The objective of this project was to implement a wearable device
prototype for fall monitoring, using accelerometer and gyroscope
sensors, and connect this monitoring to a smart home ecosystem using the Node-RED platform to manage warnings if a fall movement
is detected.

The wearable prototype developed in this work is a suitable
solution for monitoring movements, more specifically for detecting
falls. It has been proven that wearable devices developed with
inertial sensors are suitable for this type of problem and can be
used to reduce rescue time if accidents occur with elderly people,
while increasing the independence and safety of this age group in
their own houses.

Even if low-cost modules with limited computational capacity
are chosen, it is possible to implement data treatments such as
the complementary filter to increase the precision of the values
obtained and still develop reliable solutions. The approach used
in this work to develop the algorithm responsible for determining
falling movements was based on the limits found in coherent tests,
however there is room for implementing more complex computational analyzes using machine learning. These are currently topics
with great emphasis in the context of assistive technologies and can
bring more performance to solutions such as the one developed.
Finally, more and more investment is being made in smart home
applications, and the integration of several of them results in more
complete, reliable and comfortable controls. That said, a solution
like the one developed combined with other systems will guarantee
greater performance and reliability in your activities. Other systems
that have the potential to be integrated may be based on different
sensors, networks, communications protocols and algorithms. In
this work, a Wi-Fi network, MQTT protocol, accelerometer and gyroscope inertial sensors and an ESP32 board programmed through
the Arduino IDE were used, but there are more possibilities such as
bluetooth connection, cameras, presence and light sensors, HTTP
protocol and other development boards such as Arduino, Raspberry
Pi, among others.
As future work, we intend to carry out usability testing of the
wearable in a smart home environment and with elderly people,
aiming to further improve the prototype. Other real-world scenarios can be also used in tests. Fall movements can be analyzed along
with movements performed during the person’s daily routine. Historical data generated by sensors associated with machine learning
techniques can be used to more accurately identify fall situations.
Another possibility is to use other forms of fall detection, such as
analyzing images from monitoring cameras, as discussed by [ 6 ] and
*deep learning* [22].
