### **ABSTRACT**

Multimedia communication has become an essential part of social
media, with images representing a significant part of the content
on most platforms. This study investigates image content on Instagram through Meta’s internal image classification algorithm,
Automatic Alt-Text (AAT). Our approach differs from research on
data from comments and hashtags because of the use of actual
visual descriptions as the means of understanding the kinds of the
content published on the network. Our analysis of 200k posts reveals 1,471 unique tags being used to characterize image content
on Instagram, representing mostly objects, food, animals, locations
and other common components of social media photos. Notably,
we found that content about personal aesthetics is highly popular
on the platform, with person and selfie being respectively some
of the top two most common tag and post categories, being also
highly related to other tags such as makeup, lipstick and eyeliner.
Furthermore, we explored the connections between tags, representing very popular content trends within the network. Finally, we
uncover substantial differences in posting behavior of influencers
and news pages when compared to regular users, observing they
post more frequently and about more specific content, suggesting
what may attract more engagement on Instagram.

### **1 INTRODUCTION**

The Web has become an integral part of daily life for a significant
portion of the global population. With the increasing prevalence
of online social networks and the multimedia nature of communi
cation online, visual content understanding is crucial. To enhance
accessibility, various tools have been implemented to assist disabled
users in this task. One notable example is “Alt-text” (alternative
text), a textual description of an image included in the HTML code
of a webpage. It describes the appearance and function of an image
to users who cannot see it, those using screen readers, or when the
image fails to load.
In 2017, Instagram and Facebook implemented Meta’s Automatic
Alt-Text (AAT) algorithm, which automatically extracts features
from images and photos and provides tags and textual descriptions
of visual content. Meta’s AAT has proven effective in aiding blind

users to navigate these platforms and understand the image content [ 29 ]. Furthermore, recent extensions to the AAT system created
a large-scale description of content on Instagram, as this feature provided valuable details to the entire platform, beyond just assisting
visually impaired users. Image analysis poses significant challenges
for researchers due to the inherent difficulty of both manual and
automated processes to categorize its content. However, it is a key
social currency on the Web [ 13 ], and substantial insights can be
gained from analyzing images on Instagram, ranging from social
behavior [ 5 ] to political campaigns [ 22 ] and even typification of
fake profiles [ 30 ]. Most existing studies, though, rely on traditional
analysis of textual comments or hashtags from posts, which may
not accurately represent the actual content portrayed in pictures.
This study aims to analyze the structure of Meta’s Automatic
Alt-Text (AAT) system in categorizing Instagram images. We seek
to answer the following research questions: **RQ1:** What are the
most popular content tags on different Instagram user classes? **RQ2:**
What is the relationship between these contents? **RQ3:** Is there
a substantial difference between the content posted by different
types of users?
To achieve this, we utilized a custom-built data scraper to collect
61,944 Instagram accounts and 198,623 posts. This effort extracted
approximately 550k Alt-text tags describing the content of Instagram images. After that, by applying complex networks analysis,
association rules and ranking metrics, we conducted a broad analysis to better understand and categorize the content posted on
Instagram, as also the relation of these tags among the users and
its popularity.
Our results indicate that the current state of the AAT algorithm
shares similarities, but also has significant differences from what is
described in the literature. Through 1,471 unique tags used by AAT
that we found within our dataset, objects, foods, animals, locations
are among the most common topics on Instagram posts. We found
that personal aesthetic content is highly popular on Instagram, often
linked to beauty tags such as “makeup”, “lipstick”, and “eyeliner”.
Lastly, we observed substantial differences in posting behavior
between influencers, news pages, and regular users.
### **2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK**

This section shows similar, adjacent or related research to the
present work. A discussion on what alt-text is also included as
context on this papers main datapoint.
### **2.1 Automatic Alt-Text**

Alt-text is the content present in the alt attribute of HTML documents. Its original usage was to show a brief description of an
object that could not be loaded. Nowadays, it is used mainly for

accessibility purposes, allowing screen readers to describe visual
content to visually impaired users.
In social media, as content is user-uploaded, most images end
up having no alt-text associated with them. This has led many
Online Social Networks to allow users to add their own description
of the image. This feature, however, remains very underutilized.
There has been an extensive body of work focusing on alt-text,
including analyses on its manual and automated construction[ 11 ],
pre-processed image-description pair datasets[ 27 ], inquiries on
what Blind or Low-Vision (BLVs) people want from these tags[ 28 ],
as well as what harms can arise from alt-text tagging[16].
This has motivated Meta’s (by the time called Facebook) researchers to develop the technology known as Automatic Alt-Text
(AAT), with its original development being discussed in [ 29 ]. Their
article focuses on the process of assuring the system was useful to
people with vision disabilities.
### **2.2 Social Media Analysis**

The analysis and extraction of content from social networks is
increasingly relevant as these platforms have become integral to
daily life. Studies in this field offer insights into social impacts and
phenomena on these networks, as evidenced by studies like [ 2,
24 ]. One prevalent approach is sentiment analysis through various
strategies, ranging from simplified methods like the influential
study by [ 14 ] to more advanced neural network techniques [ 23, 25 ].
These studies aim to computationally classify the emotional content
of sentences, a complex task with numerous applications [8, 9].
Other approaches focus on understanding social media dynamics,
such as Complex Network modeling, which provides deep explanatory insights into relationships. A notable study in this area by [ 7 ]
used Twitter data to show that follower count alone is not a good
metric for influence on the network. Other similar works include

[ 18, 19, 26 ]. Twitter has been extensively studied due to its APIs
and openness to academic research. However, with recent changes,
there is a growing trend towards studying other social networks.
Despite challenges in extracting data from less accessible networks,
research on these platforms, such as the work by [ 21 ], highlights the
value of image content and systematizes the investigation of fake
news, revealing how messaging apps function as social networks.
The focus on images, which are computationally more costly to
analyze than texts, partly explains the fewer studies on Instagram

[ 13 ]. Nonetheless, significant studies on Instagram do exist. For
instance, [ 12 ] used Complex Network modeling to analyze community interactions during elections. Other studies, like [ 10, 15 ] also
use this approach.
Some research examines the social implications of image content
across various platforms, such as [ 3, 4 ]. The foundational study by

[ 13 ] is one of the few focusing on understanding Instagram’s image
content. Using early computer vision mechanisms, the authors
identified challenges like defining relevant categories and the high
computational cost. This study, by categorizing images from various
users, directly connects to our work. Other studies, such as [ 22 ]
and [20] also focus on the image content on Instagram

### **2.3 Research Gap**

Instagram is predominantly a visual platform; however, most studies focus on the textual content of posts, such as comments, which
may not accurately reflect the platform’s full picture. By analyzing
the alt-text descriptions of images, this study aims to bridge this
gap, providing greater transparency and understanding of Instagram. It seeks to deepen the discussion about the topics present in
this environment.
### **3 METHODOLOGY**

In this section, we describe the approach and strategies used to
gather process and analyze data from Instagram’s webpage. It details the methodology used for data collection, analysis, and also
relevant limitations encountered during the study. The methodology is divided into three main parts: Data Collection, Data Analysis,
and Limitations.
### **3.1 Data Collection**

To investigate Meta’s Automatic Alt-Text (AAT) data on Instagram,
we utilized a custom-built data scraper developed using Selenium [1],
a tool that automates web browser navigation, enabling us to collect
data without the use of APIs.

The time period of the data collection was between 09/2023 and
02/2024, about six months. This was the time we needed to have a
sample close in size to the one Meta’s researchers used to build the
AAT algorithm[ 29 ], both having about 200K posts. It is important
to note that the our scraper collected posts going from most recent
to older, so some posts may be from dates prior to the start of
the extraction, having been posted previously. Since Regular Users
might not post anything for very long periods of time, their posts
are from an irregular time period. One observation noted from
checking these is that posts from before 2018 have no AAT tags,
matching the time frame from the original paper, published in 2017.
Some of the challenges presented were dynamic content loading, frequent changes in Instagram’s HTML structure, rate limiting
and blocking, and obfuscated tags. Dynamic content loading requires waiting for the content to fully load before extracting alt
text. Updates to Instagram’s HTML structure break scraping scripts,
requiring updates. Additionally, Instagram imposes rate limits on
requests, which can lead to IP blocking or suspension. Moreover,
Instagram’s web version does not show posts if no account is logged
in. Requests made in this context repeatedly return pages reporting
an error. In order to collect Instagram data, one must be logged in
to a valid, not-banned account. To manage these obstacles, 8 collection accounts were created. The crawler then cyclically changes the
account used to scrape Instagram profiles, through Selenium, preventing individual accounts from exceeding limits without delaying
extraction. We observed the most common way to get an account
banned is to log in manually multiple times in a short period.
The data collection loop, which directly interacts with a user’s
page on the network, operates as follows: first, it checks if the
current account to be extracted is already in the database. If not, a
new data point is created, containing the username and the total
number of posts from that profile. The algorithm then proceeds to
the next step, scrolling and accessing each post on the account to

check if they contain alt-text, until the end of the page is reached
or one of several code-imposed limits is hit to avoid unnecessary
operations. With the web-scraper implemented, we targeted three
main types of Instagram users for data collection:
**Influencers:** We start our profile’s collection with the most popular
accounts within the network. These influential users were obtained
from HypeAuditor’s ranking of the top 1000 accounts [2] with the
most engagement, which calculates the ranking as a composite
measure of total followers and the average number of likes and
comments per post. These profiles mainly belong to celebrities (such
as @cristiano and @taylorswift ), but also include some politicians (e.g. @narendramodi ) and a few “ *meme pages* ” (e.g. @9gag ).
86 accounts were excluded from top 1000 for reasons as the profiles
being deactivated, turning private, or archiving posts.
**News Pages:** Profiles from this category represent respected news
outlets, tabloids, gossip magazines and information-focused pages.
These were selected starting from manually selected "seeds", mainstream news outlet users (e.g. @nytimes ), which were then used
to acquire more news pages through Instagram’s recommendation
system. A total of 59 pages were found and collected through this
process. This fewer number of profiles was enough to reach a similar number of publications, as shown in Table 1, in which the 59
news pages have, in sum, more posts than the 914 Influencers.
**Regular Users:** Also included were ordinary Instagram users. Due
to the vast size of the Instagram network and its restrictions, we
developed a strategy to incorporate a diverse set of profiles to our
data collection. To achieve this, we collected the usernames of
followers of Influencer and News profiles. This aimed to increase
the randomness and variation on the sample, as popular profiles
usually have a set of followers with a wide range of interests and
demographics. This method allowed us to include a sample of 60,971
general Instagram user base and 150,662 posts in our analysis.
### **3.2 Instagram Alt-text Structure**

After collecting data from Instagram users and their posts, it is
essential to understand the formatting of posts and the placement
of alt text for effective data collection. This subsection explains the
structure of a typical Instagram post, how alt text is integrated, and
the challenges associated with extracting this information.
A typical Instagram post consists of visual content (images or
videos), textual content (captions, comments, and hashtags), and

**Figure 2: Example of alt-text structure of Instagram post.**

**Figure 3: Features extracted from the Instagram alt-text.**

alt-text, which is a hidden layer of textual information associated
with the visual content. The alt-text is embedded within the <img>
in the HTML structure of an Instagram post, specifically as the
value of its alt attribute. After reaching the actual content of alttext, it can be presented in different formats and variations. We
outlined the alt-text structure to classify and utilize it effectively.
One of the first observations was that not all images containing
alt-text have image “classification tags”. This aligns with Meta’s
information on [ 29 ], which explains that before the AAT technology
was implemented, alt-texts were either manually added by users,
which was very rare, or it had the generic “User’s Photo” phrase
attached to it. Another alt-text format containing no tags only
includes the preamble, similar to that shown in Figure 2.
Finally, most of the AAT content has a structure similar to the
format portrayed in Figure 3, highlighting how the alt text is located
within the HTML code. The uncovered structure revealed three

main features in the Instagram alt-text: (1) An “ **Image Class** ” at
the beginning of the AAT, represented by the description “ *May*
*be a ***** ”; (2) a set of “ **Description Tags** ”, which are class labels
assigned to images with the aim of describing the visual content; and
occasionally (3) “ **OCR text** ”, which represent actual text present
within the images.
With the AAT features defined, we implemented an algorithm to
process this information. Using Python, we created the TextContent
class. This class receives an alt-text string and divides it into the
relevant features, accessed via the class’ getters. All tag analysis
operations were mediated by this structure, reducing errors and
simplifying manipulation. Data collection results are summarized
in Table 1. Our final dataset includes over 60,000 users and approximately 200,000 posts, from which we extracted around 550,000
alt-text tags that describe the content of the images on Instagram.
### **3.3 Limitations**

There are some limitations associated with this collecting methodology and the resulting dataset. Beyond all restrictions imposed by
Instagram to gather data from the platform, the main limitation
is that, considering that Instagram has more than a billion users
worldwide, our collection of 60k users and 200K posts represents a
small sample, not necessarily representative of the entirety of the
network. However other key studies in the field use datasets of similar sizes, with Meta using exactly 200K posts to build sample what
tags they would need to initially build AAT algorithm[ 29 ]. Also,
given the AAT system automatically assigns tags to the images, the
data may present some mislabeled content, and we cannot ensure
the quality of the image labeling. That said, this is the actual tool
Instagram uses to provide information for the screen reader users,
and thus our view of the content is the same a BLV user may have
within the platform.
### **4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS**

In this section, we present our analysis of the data collected. We
examine the structure of Meta’s AAT system, using tools such as
complex networks and association rules metrics, focusing on how
it categorizes and describes visual content. Our findings include an
analysis of tag popularity, relationships between alt-text tags, and
a comparison of the content shared by regular users, news pages,
and Influencers.
### **4.1 Post Types on Instagram**

Once the data was pre-processed and ready, we began the analysis
and understanding of Instagram content. Figure 4 illustrates the
high-level classification of Instagram images by AAT. This classification reveals key differences in content types shared by various
user groups. The “ *Image Class* ” feature is the first description the

Tag Frequency (log)

**Figure 5: CDF of popularity of each tag.**

AAT algorithm provides for users, serving as a general guide to
what type of post the image could be. Although most content is
classified as an image, Instagram differentiates whether the content
is also a selfie, a meme, an illustration and other types. Unlike tags,
a post can belong to only one ImageClass. When considering all 15
classes found, however, the methodology behind their definition is
not clear. About half of the classes are art-related (illustration, doodle, pop art, art, cartoon, anime-style image, and drawing), with no
obvious distinction among them. Although some classes have more
well-defined content, such as “selfie”, “back-and-white images” or
“anime-style”, manual observation within each class did not clarify
the specific reasoning behind this labeling.
### **4.2 RQ1: Content Popularity by User Type**

We also analyzed the popularity of the description tags provided
by Meta’s Automatic Alt-Text (AAT) system. The number of tags
per post varies, with some posts having only one tag and others
containing up to ten tags. Our findings show that only a few tags
appear just once, and more than 95% of tags are present in at least
2 or more posts. This suggests Instagram has limited pre-built tag
classes that they assign to describe images on the platform. Also,
about 65% of the tags appear up to 100 times among the images and
approximately 5% of the tags are highly popular, present in more
than 1,000 different posts as shown in CDF of Figure 5.

**Table 2: Ranking of top 10 most popular tags on Instagram.**

**Figure 6: Manual classification of tag categories.**

**Figure 7: Tag specificity/generalization level per type.**

Additionally, we examined the rankings of the most popular tags,
as shown in Table 2. This table lists the most frequent tags for each
user type. We observed that for all user types, tags like “ *text* ” and “ *1*
*person* ” are the most common. This aligns with findings from other
studies, such as [ 5 ] and [ 13 ], indicating that individual photos of
people with some captions are extremely popular on the Instagram.
Other frequently tags, such as “ *selfie* ”, “ *hair* ” and “ *beard* ” further
highlights the prevalence of personal photos on the platform.
In total, we extracted 546.152 tags among the posts within our
dataset; however, we found those tags comprise a total of only 1,471
unique tags used by Instagram to describe the image content. To
have a wide view of what those tags are and the actual content
of Instagram images, we manually labeled them into broader categories, following a similar approach of authors from [ 13 ]. This
categorization was done through iterative labeling, in which each
step the categories were grouped, resulting in 14 classes by the end,
as illustrated in Figure 6. Interestingly, we also observed and labeled
a different degree of specificity/generalization of each tag. While
some tags represent very general concepts, such as “ *text* ”, some
are very specialized. For example, Instagram differentiates a lot of
specific cat and dog breeds, as well as famous real-world locations.


Figure 7 represents the portion of tags defined as general specific.
For example, “ *duck* ” is considered a general tag, whereas “ *mallard* ”
is specific. Following this process, we discovered that objects, food
and animals are the categories with most tag variation on Instagram. An interesting observation from this is that the categories
with more tags are not necessarily the most popular among posts.
Furthermore, we find a redundancy among tags. For instance, tags
such as “ *soccer* ” is accompanied by tags such as “ *playing soccer* ”
and “ *people playing soccer* ”. These specific action tags could reflect
results from [ 29 ] in which impaired users indicated that people are
the most interesting part of an image, especially their mood and
what they were doing (action).
Additionally, we found typos in tags like “ *acquatic animal* ” and
“ *riding a crousel* ”, in which all occurrences have the same error, but
this did not repeat in tags such as “ *carousel* ” and “ *people riding a*
*carousel* ”.
### **4.3 RQ2: How AAT Content Interacts on** **Instagram**

Next, we focused on the relation between kinds of image content
posted on Instagram by investigating common co-occurrence of
tags within our dataset. To consider what users usually put together
on their photos on Instagram, we firstly use complex network
analysis to develop the graph of tags presented in Figure 8 and assess
common paths that posts follow on the network with community
algorithms. In this graph, the nodes represent each of the tags
collected, and each edge represents the co-occurrence of two tags
in a post; edges are weighted by how many times the tags appeared
together. The size of a node is determined by its degree, with the
most well-connected nodes being the largest. As expected, these
are nodes such as “ *text* ‘ and “ *1 person* “, which are the top 1 and 2
most frequent within the dataset.
The grouping of nodes was made using the Community Detection algorithm described by [ 6 ], as implemented in Gephi. It resulted in uncovering the 10 communities, 8 of which had a relevant
enough size, differentiated by color in the graph. It is interesting to
observe how some types of content are grouped on Instagram and
tend to appear together in a post. Examples such as “ *cup* “, “ *bottle* “
and “ *tea* “ linked together show how objects that one would expect
to be together actually appear in images. In the same direction
we also have “ *lipstick* “, “ *makeup* “, “ *hair* “, “ *eyeliner* “, all around “ *1*
*person* “ suggesting the popularity of such kind of selfies within
the network. In general, our findings on this network analysis revealed linked groups of content representing as following: **Red** :
Generally contains objects associated with apparel. Mirrors the
“Fashion” category from [ 13 ]; **Pink** : includes most of the “People
Count” mentioned in the original AAT paper[ 29 ]. Also includes
objects, notably things that usually appear alongside people; **Cyan** :
Represents landscapes, their components and some outdoor activities; **Light Green** : Contains food and kitchen utensils. Also, a
category in [ 13 ]; **Dark Green** : Species of animals, plants and types
of furniture; **Deep Blue** : Includes only flowers and four other tags,
those being “ *bouquet* ”, “ *vase* ” and “ *flower pot* ”; **Grey** : Vehicles, animals used in transportation and some other apparently unrelated
critters; **Brown** : Eight out of the nine items in this category are
containers, such as “ *bag* ”, “ *wallet* ”, “ *purse* ” and “ *suitcase* ”.

**Figure 8: Network of tag relationships. Nodes are tags and edge means co-ocurrence in same post.**


**Association Rules** : The second approach to understand relationships between content is extracting the association rules through
Apriori Mining algorithm [ 1 ], which can be used to point pairs or
sets of tags that have high probabilities to appear together within a
post. Since the large differences between user types were shown,
the rule mining was applied separately on news pages, regular users
and Influencers.
On the news pages set, there are many high-confidence association rules on pairs, especially those following the pattern (people
count tag) -> (text), with a confidence above 0.9 This helps
to explain posts frequently seen in news pages, in which people
involved in some news-worthy project are depicted along with text
that gives context. Other similar rules are (1 person, poster,
magazine) -> (text) and (2 people, poster, magazine) ->
(text) . These show a very similar pattern, but they also include
other common tags for news publications. In general, those rules
suggest news pages have a much more homogeneous posting format, depicting usually a person or other object in a specific format
of poster accompanied by some text describing the news headline.
The influencer users are those with the most association rules. A
very representative and high confidence rule is (stadium, playing
soccer) -> (text, 1 person, playing football), which includes most of the tags associated with the sport. One reason for
this may come from the AAT redundancy in action tags and the


absence of difference between “ *soccer* ” and “ *football* ”. Additionally,
several famous football players are among the top 1000 most influential users in our dataset due to the list used to collect them,
contributing to the popularity of this type of content within this
user category. However, these also evidence that thematic posts of
soccer are prevalent for those users. On the other hand, few rules
have the tag “ *ball* ”, suggesting that, despite the theme, the game
itself is not the focus of the post. One of the main rules that is not
related to sport is (makeup, 1 person) -> (text), a rule seemingly more representative of the artists and other influencers of this
category. Note the presence of textual content in these influencers
rules, which is a common format for events, advertises, sponsored
posts and other communication tools that celebrity accounts are
used to post on Instagram.
Finally, the tags associated with the regular user type are much
more diverse than those of the other categories, but generally have
lower confidence levels. For instance, the rule (smiling) -> (1
person) has a confidence of 0.96, which is higher than most others.
We also observe pairs such as (ocean) -> (beach), with a confidence of 0.62. Interestingly, rules related to makeup appear more
frequently and with higher confidence. For example, (lipstick)
-> (makeup), (eyeliner) -> (makeup), (makeup, eyeliner)
-> (1 person), and (makeup, blonde hair) -> (1 person),
all of which have confidence levels close to 0.7. Additionally with

**Figure 9: Differences in engagement for different user types.**

“person” and “selfie” being the second most common tags and post
categories, it is evident that content about personal aesthetics is
highly popular on Instagram. These findings indicate that users are
highly engaged with content related to personal appearance and
self-expression.
### **4.4 RQ3: Posting Behavior by User Type**

Next, we explore the differences in posting behavior and engagement across different kinds user classes. We analyze the frequency
of posts, the number of tags per post, as well as engagement metrics such as likes and comments from regular users, news pages
Influencer profiles. These insights help us understand how different
user types utilize the platform and how their content resonates
with their audience.
**Differences in Engagement:** First, we examined some engagement metrics such as likes and comments per post, as shown in
Figure 9. Influencers generally receive more likes and comments
compared to regular users and news pages, reflecting their higher
engagement levels due to their follower base and the nature of
their content. It is notable that for regular users, about 20% and 60%
of their posts have no likes and no comments at all, respectively.
On the other hand, almost all influencer’s posts reach more than
100k likes and 100 comments. For comparison, only 25% of news
posts have similar likes. However, looking at the number of posts
per type of user (Figure 9c, we can note that influencers are not
the users with the most posts. News pages have a much higher
number of posts than other types, with all news pages collected
having more than 1,000 posts in their profiles, while less than 1%
of regular users and just 40% of influencers have such numbers.
News pages post most frequently, often several times a day. This
contrasts with Regular users, where almost 40% have zero posts
and about 90% have up to 100 posts. Since Regular users typically

have no economic or professional reasons to post frequently, their
totals are usually much lower.
**Differences in Content:** After evaluating some posting behaviors,
we take our attention to the actual content of the publication of
each types of users. First, we see the tag frequency of their posts
in the histogram of Figure 10. While about 60% of regular users’
posts have up to 3 tags, we observe influencers generally have more
tags within their publications. This suggests influencers have a
higher variety of content in a single post. Also, it can be attributed
to product placement, showing various objects, and the diverse
lifestyles of celebrities and politicians. No posts from news pages
have zero tags, but almost 50% have exactly two tags. This is because
most images from news pages include a text, thus heavily increasing
the chances of including the “ *text* ” tagging, consequently also have
the OCR property, which is enough to describe the image without
additional tags required.
To further measure the differences between content published by
user types, we applied Kendall’s Tau rank correlation metric [ 17 ] to
compare rankings of the top 10, 100, and 992 tags of each account
class, as shown in Table 3. The number 992 was used instead of
1000 because that was the total number of tags in the news pages
dataset. Considering the top 10 tags of each set, the Kendall’s Tau
results show weak negative associations ( *𝜏* *<* 0) between Regular/Influencer and Influencer/News pages. The strongest negative
correlation is between News pages and Regular users, indicating
a moderate but significant negative association, suggesting News
accounts are the most distinct user category.
The correlation results from Kendall’s Tau show that there are
substantial differences between all the types of users. Even when
considering most of the tags, the positive correlation is at best
moderate, suggesting some content is always popular. As comparison, we also apply Kendall Tau it to another set: two randomly
distributed, equally sized partitions of the "Regular user" dataset.
The results, shown in Table 4, indicate a strong positive correlation
and that random samples would present similar tags ( *𝜏* *>* 0 *.* 87)
among their content. This confirms that the negative correlations
observed between user types are not random, and makes it evident
that they have different behavior on Instagram.

### **5 CONCLUSION**

In this study, we conducted an extensive investigation of image
content on Instagram through AAT system. By analyzing alt-text
data from nearly 200,000 user posts collected from 60,000 Instagram
users, we provided significant insights into the visual content shared
on the platform.
Our findings reveal 1,471 unique tags used by Instagram to categorize content, composed mostly of objects, food, animals, and
locations. These show that content related to personal aesthetics,
such as makeup, lipstick, and eyeliner, are highly popular on Instagram. Additionally, we identified several tags that are frequently
connected, forming popular content trends within the network.
Moreover, we highlight differences in the content shared by news
pages, Influencers, and regular users. Notably, news pages tend to
post images containing text, while Influencers often share content
related to personal aesthetics and activities, such sports. Regular
users, on the other hand, post a diverse range of content, although
having fewer tags per post.
Our research also highlighted the evolution of the AAT algorithm, noting the introduction of many new tags, including some
seemingly redundant. Future studies could expand on this work by
incorporating larger samples and applying AAT context to studies
on political campaigns, mental health, and disinformation on Instagram. Our approach offers a fresh perspective that complements
existing research, enhancing our understanding of the diverse and
dynamic nature of content shared on this social network.
