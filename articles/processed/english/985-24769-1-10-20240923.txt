### **ABSTRACT**

The influence of online social networks on people‚Äôs actions and
beliefs has grown significantly over the past decade, impacting
everyday life. This is especially evident in Brazil, where these platforms have been instrumental in disseminating political content
rapidly and widely. In this work, we aim to understand how the political debate surrounding the Brazilian elections of 2022 on Twitter
unfolds through different levels of user engagement. We provide a
content analysis that unveils the main topics discussed by different
users, regardless of the strength of their interactions. Our results
enrich the understanding of how online discussions evolved on
social media during this important event in the recent history of
democracy in Brazil.

### **1 INTRODUCTION**

Online Social Media Platforms (OSMPs) have served as one of
the main stages for the organization and development of many
significant social movements worldwide, from health [ 8, 21 ] to
politics [ 9, 34 ]. Platforms such as (former) Twitter [1] [ 30 ], WhatsApp

[ 25, 26, 29 ] and Telegram [ 37 ], have been the focus of many works
that aimed to analyze how information is disseminated in such
platforms and its implications to societies.
This scenario is no different in Brazil, where OSMPs have been
mainly used for political debates. Several studies in the literature

[ 3, 4, 10, 12, 16, 17, 20, 27, 29, 31, 34, 37 ] characterized the Brazilian political debates across a variety of platforms. In contrast to
previous work that focused on Twitter, we here provide a more
comprehensive analysis of the Brazilian political landscape of 2022
by using network modeling and backbone extraction methods to
show how the political debate unfolds through different levels of
user engagement and diffusion. To accomplish this, we crawled
Twitter to collect about 741K shared tweets covering the days of
the two election. We then model the information spread during

platform¬¥s name as our study relies on features commonly associated with it.

each round using a media-centric network that connects users who
shared the same content (overall network) and employ backbone
extraction methods to identify the group of users who frequently
share the same pieces of information [ 18, 33 ]. These users are placed
in the core of the media-centric network, thereby driving the election debate on Twitter. Finally, we analyzed the text shared by the
users from three different (yet complementary) perspectives: topic
extraction, sentiment analysis, and psycholinguistic analysis.
Our main findings are as follows: (i) The identification of backbone networks reveals a set of users engaged through stronger
interactions. This structured network may prompt these users to
act more cohesively in promoting specific content, thereby influencing discourse on a particular topic. (ii) The topics diffused by
users in backbones differ from those shared by the overall network. Interestingly, the most shared topics in these backbones, not
present in the overall network, are more aligned with supporting
the candidate Luis In√°cio Lula da Silva and celebrating his victory.
(iii) There is a small set of users who shared a significant amount
of information across both election rounds, with a higher potential
to reach a larger audience due to their above-average number of
followers in our dataset.
### **2 RELATED WORK**

Our work is not the first to examine the Brazilian political scenario on OSMPs. The authors in [ 25, 26 ] analyzed the messages
exchanged on WhatsApp during the 2018 Brazilian general elections. Similar to our work, the authors built a network based on
users that shared the same content messages in one or more groups.
They also employed backbone extraction techniques to search for
strongly connected user communities to evidence possible coordination actions in sharing specific content. In the same direction,
Machado *et al.* [ 20 ] explored misinformation in WhatsApp content
during the same election period. The main results showed that viral
content in WhatsApp groups was mainly based on hate speech
and fake news. In [ 3 ], the authors characterized the tweets of preelection advertisement for the 2016, 2018 and 2020 elections. By
applying psycholinguistic and sentiment analysis techniques, the
results showed that early advertisements are usually negative or
neutral, with the neutral sentiment growing over time, and there is
a pattern in the use of hashtags and links, along with mentions to

entities.
Focusing specifically on the 2022 Brazilian elections, the study of
Ven√¢ncio et al . [37] applied the methodology of backbone extraction

to search for evidences of coordination in the information dissemi
nation on Telegram. This study not only highlighted the growing
influence of messaging apps on political mobilization, but also contributed to the understanding of digital communication strategies in
modern electoral contexts. The authors in [ 23 ] collected data from
an online experiment where participants built personalized government programs by combining policies proposed by the candidates
of the 2022 French and Brazilian presidential elections, identifying
polarizing proposals. Santana *et al.* presented a study that analyzed
the use and engagement of the TikTok profiles of the two leading
candidates: Lula and Bolsonaro [ 31 ]. The authors in [ 17 ] applied
sentiment analysis in order to identify gender bias on comments
on YouTube in the 2018 and 2022 elections.

In the context of Twitter, Silva and Faria [ 34 ] analyzed the sentiments expressed by Twitter users regarding the presidential candidates, with the aim of verifying whether the candidates‚Äô performance is related to their popularity on social media. The authors in

[ 32 ] analyzed the opinions of Brazilians about the candidates using
machine learning techniques. The work in [ 4 ] investigated how
sentiment analysis was a prominent factor in interpreting the possible relationship between the opinions of social media users and the
final result of the 2018 elections in Brazil. Paiva *et al.* focused on
understanding how some feminist causes were addressed during
the elections [ 27 ]. Finally, the authors in [ 16 ] developed a methodology, which is a similar approach used in our work, to discover
the contribution of specific groups to network polarization.
The investigation we offer here complements the aforementioned
studies and greatly builds on their findings by offering a broader
set of analysis on a large Twitter dataset. We rely on backbone extraction methods to show how the political debate unfolds through
different levels of users‚Äô engagement. Our results enrich the understanding of how online discussions evolved on social media during
this important event in the recent history of democracy in Brazil.
### **3 METHODOLOGY**

This section describes our methodology, including data collection,
modeling and analysis.
### **3.1 Dataset**

We collect Portuguese-language tweets shared during the two
rounds of 2022 Brazilian general elections, occurred on October
2 *[ùëõùëë]*, 2022 and October 30 *[ùë°‚Ñé]*, 2022.
The collection was done using the Twitter API Search. [2] We built
a list of keywords that include terms such as the official election
keyword used by the Twitter and the most important presidential
candidates. Specifically, we consider the following list of keywords:
*Elei√ß√µes2022* [3] *, Lula, Bolsonaro, Ciro, SimoneTebet* . [4]

Table 1 show the total number of unique tweets and retweets
for each keyword, after filtering tweets with at least two users
in the dataset that retweeted that message. Furthermore, tweets
with the same ID that contain multiple keywords were counted
only once. We analyzed approximately 741K shared tweets across

3 Elections2022
4 These candidates accounted for over 98% of all votes.


the two election rounds. As expected, in our dataset the official
Twitter general election keyword ( *Elei√ß√µes2022* ) is the most shared
one, followed by the keywords with the name of the two main
presidential candidates.

**Table 1: First and Second Round Datasets.**

**Keywords** **First Round** **Second Round**
**# Unique** **# Unique**
**# Retweets** **# Retweets**
**Tweets** **Tweets**

*Elei* *√ß* *√µes2022* 2,145 186,594 875 153,525
*Bolsonaro* 3,771 154,165 2,716 112,840

*Lula* 3,094 100,066 2,930 96,546

*Ciro* 1,705 44,185 445 11,995

*SimoneTebet* 4 64 4 197

**Total** 8,774 409,956 5,835 331,175

To provide a first overview of our data, we look into the contents
of the collected retweets. We do so by showing in Figure 1 the word
clouds with the top 100 most frequent words (in numbers of the
retweets) during the first and second election rounds. In the first
round (Figure 1.a) we note that elections related words are predominant, such as *vote* and *president* . Interestingly, the term electronic
voting machine is also one of the most used terms, probably due to
the suspicion about its credibility raised by the supporters of Jair
Bolsonaro candidate. [5] During the second round word cloud (Figure
1.b), we observe the presence of words celebrating the victory of
the Luis In√°cio Lula da Silva, such as *victory*, *lulapresidente2022*,
*democracy* . Finally, it is worth noting the presence of the word
*Northeast* in both election rounds, which is a Brazilian region in
which Lula has many supporters. [6]
### **3.2 Network Modeling**

To investigate the 2022 election debate on Twitter, we employed a
network model, known as *media-centric* network, which connects
users who shared similar content [ 5, 18, 25, 26 ]. By analyzing the
properties of such media-centric networks, we are able to determine
which actors contribute the most to content propagation.
We built two graphs, where each graph represents a mediacentric network capturing the user sharing patterns during each
election round. In each graph *ùê∫* ( *ùëâ, ùê∏* ), a node *ùë£* ‚àà *ùëâ* corresponds
to a user who retweeted a tweet, and an undirected edge *ùëí* =( *ùë£* *ùëñ*, *ùë£* *ùëó* )
is included in *ùê∏* if the users corresponding to *ùë£* *ùëñ* and *ùë£* *ùëó* shared the
same tweet (exactly the same textual content) at least once. The
weight of *ùëí* is the number of tweets both users shared in common.
The total amount of retweets shared across each network is the

sum of all edge weights.
### **3.3** **Key Users Identification**

In addition to providing a general overview of content dissemination on Twitter, the media-centric network model allows us to
identify the group of users who frequently share the same pieces of

information, thereby driving the election debate on Twitter. Here,
we denote these users as *key users* .
We next focus on finding pairs of users whose sharing patterns
are non-random (strong). In other words, we filter out noisy or
sporadic edges, revealing only pairs of users whose shared tweets
deviate disproportionately from the expected number of content
shares. To that end, we used the DF+NB network backbone extraction method from the literature to filter out weaker edges, thus
retaining only stronger edges [ 18 ]. DF+NB method combines the
Disparity Filter method [ 25, 33 ] with the concept of Neighborhood
Overlap. Specifically, DF considers as reference model for a user
sharing content independently of the others a uniform distribution
of the edge weights incident to the corresponding node. Thus, an
edge ( *ùë£* *ùëñ* *, ùë£* *ùëó* ) is retained in the backbone if its weight greatly deviates
(from a statistical point of view) from this reference model for both
*ùë£* *ùëñ* and *ùë£* *ùëó* . This method effectively highlights edges that demonstrate
consistent and repeated behavior between pairs of users. With the
Neighborhood Overlap filter, DF+NB goes further by removing peripheral and bridge connections, focusing on edges between users
with common neighbors who also share similar patterns of content
dissemination. DF+NB showed to be more effective in scenarios
with high levels of noise, as data collected from Twitter [18].
To parametrize the DF+NB method, we set *ùõº* = 0 *.* 05, which represents the evidence of the existence of users whose shared same

content [ 13 ]. This parameter is the p-value used to test against the
assumption of uniform distribution for independent behavior. For
the filter based on the neighborhood overlap metric, we assume the
threshold given by the 95 *[ùë°‚Ñé]* percentile of the neighborhood overlap
distribution.

After extracting the backbone of each graph, we applied the
widely used Louvain community detection algorithm [ 2 ] to identify
and analyze patterns of user groupings and their organization in
each backbone. The goal of the Louvain algorithm is to maximize
community modularity, which is a key metric representing the
density of connections within communities compared to a hypothetical random network. Modularity values range from -0.5 to +1,
with higher scores (above 0.3) indicating well-defined community
structures [24].
### **3.4 Content Analysis**

Besides identifying the key users who shared a high volume of
similar information during the two election rounds, we are also
interested in characterizing what they were talking about. In other


words, this study focuses on retweets to analyze content dissemination and user behavior in the electoral context. To achieve this,
we analyzed the text shared by them from three different (yet complementary) perspectives: topic extraction, sentiment analysis, and
psycholinguistic analysis.

*3.4.1* *Topic Extraction.* To identify the debated topics, we applied
the BERTopic model [ 14 ], which was proved to be one of the best
models for the analysis of short-text data [6].
The process of BERTopic begins with converting a collection
of retweets into vector representations using the BERTimbau, a
Portuguese language pre-trained model as a base for the transformer in order to improve the performance [ 11, 22, 28, 35 ]. Subsequently, the dimensionality of these vectors is reduced using the
*Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Re-*
*duction* (UMAP) technique, enhancing the efficiency of subsequent
clustering processes. Following the dimensionality reduction, the
*Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with*
*Noise* (HDBSCAN) algorithm groups these low-dimensional vector
representations into clusters based on semantic similarities. These
clusters (or documents) are then analyzed using the *Class-based*
*Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency* (c-TF-IDF) technique
to identify distinctive words for each cluster, thereby defining the
topics associated with each group of retweets. Here, the *Maxi-*
*mal Marginal Relevance* (MMR) parameter was applied in order to
achieve better diversification between the topics‚Äô keywords. This
parameter limits the number of duplicated words among the topics,
comparing word embeddings with topic embedding. It also leads
to a less occurrence of synonyms among the topics, making them
more concise and avoiding redundancy.
For the parameterization, we followed the recommendations
in the BERTopic documentation to find a balanced compromise
between the number of topics and the size of the dataset. [7] As a
result, we obtain the following parameterization: the number of
neighbors and the component parameters required by UMAP were
set to 10 and 5, respectively. The minimum topic size was set to
5, which controls the minimum number of unique retweets on a
topic. The minimum number of words required to visualize topics
contents was set to 20, in order to inform broader content about
the topics‚Äô subjects and their relation to the elections. Finally, MMR
was adjusted to 0.6 (on a scale of 0 to 1).

*3.4.2* *Psycholinguistic Analysis.* We delve deeper into the content
analysis by understanding the psycholinguistic properties of the
shared text. We rely on the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
(LIWC) lexicon [ 36 ] to categorize words in the text in linguistic
style, affective and cognitive attributes. We then compute the average frequency of the attributes over the retweets. In our data, we
identify all 64 attributes, out of the available in LIWC‚Äôs Portuguese
dictionary.
We then identify attributes that characterize the discourse on
our data. We rank the attributes according to their capacity to
discriminate the retweets, estimated by the Gini Coefficient [ 38 ]
and we use the top-10 to create heatmaps that can better highlight
attributes associated with our dataset.

The heatmap cells in a column indicate the relative deviation of
the given attribute for the given keyword from the other keywords.
In other words, each column (attribute) is normalized following the
z-score ‚Äì i.e., *ùëß* = ( *ùë•* ‚àí *ùëöùëíùëéùëõ* )/ *ùë†ùë°ùëë* . Thus, each value gets subtracted
from the average of the column, then divided by the standard deviation of the column. Locations are color-coded red (resp. blue)
when the attribute is more (resp. less) present than the average.

*3.4.3* *Sentiment Analysis.* Finally, we study the sentiments expressed by individuals debating the elections on Twitter. For this
purpose, we used the XLM-RoBERTa [8] ( *Cross Lingual Language*
*Model - Robustly Optimized BERT-Pretraining Approach* ) model,
which is available on the Hugging Face library. This model is a
fine-tuned version of RoBERTa [ 19 ], trained on a Twitter database
containing 198 million multilingual tweets, with Portuguese being
the second most frequently occurring language in these tweets. The
XLM-RoBERTa model returns the probabilities of a particular tweet
being classified as positive, negative, or neutral. In our analysis,
we classify the sentiment of a tweet as the class with the highest
probability assigned by the model.
### **4 RESULTS**

This section presents our results and their findings.
### **4.1 Topological Analysis**

Table 2 shows the analysis of the network topologies for the two
events of interest, revealing distinct structures between the complete networks and their respective backbones. DF+NB significantly
reduces the weak links in both graphs, leading to reductions in the
number of nodes and edges. Considering the first round, the complete network consists of 71,585 nodes and 192,539,317 edges with
an average degree of 5,379.32. In contrast, applying the DF+NB
method reduces this network to 5,192 nodes and 137,165 edges. In

8 https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/xlm-roberta


the second round, instead, the complete network consists of 60,288
nodes and 152,603,351 edges with an average degree of 5,062.48.
Applying the DF+NB method reduces this network to 3,704 nodes
and 33,480 edges. Both backbones highlight the users who are most
active in sharing content: they retweeted, approximately, 16% and
10% of the produced tweets.
Our results also show the increase in the modularity metric,
especially regarding the backbones. This suggests a highly connected and structured community networks, showing the potential
of DF+NB in filtering out noise in the data. Moreover, this increase
in modularity reveals the growing complexity of the interaction network across the two election rounds, which is further highlighted
by the rise in the number of larger communities in the resulting
topologies.
*Takeaway.* The identification of backbone networks reveals a set
of users engaged through stronger interactions. This structured network may prompt these users to act more cohesively in promoting
specific content, thereby influencing the discourse.
### **4.2 Content Analysis**

Here, we split our content analysis into two types of dissemination:
*widespread dissemination*, which examines the complete mediacentric networks of the two election rounds, and *key users‚Äô dissemi-*
*nation*, where we analyze only the retweets shared by the users in
the backbones. While the former provides a broader overview of
the debate surrounding the theme we are interested in, the latter
allows us to delve deeper into the core of the discussion, filtering
out the weak interactions that may obscure the main topics and
concerns regarding the Brazilian elections.

*4.2.1* *Widespread Dissemination.* We first look at the disseminated
topics by all Twitter users in our dataset. This analysis was performed using the BERTopic model for the tweets disseminated
over the two election rounds. Initially, 192 topics were identified
through the application of BERTopic. However, in order to focus
our analysis on the most influential discussions, we prioritize the
20 most popular discussed topics, in number of retweets, being able
to shed light on the predominant themes of the Twitter users. Table
3 provides a comprehensive overview of the final topics, including
the most discriminating words and a brief description of each topic.
Topics 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 18 are mainly related to Lula‚Äôs
victory. Topics 1 and 18 highlight the Brazilian regions in which
Lula was the candidate winner as well as the fact that the United
States President, Joe Biden, was a one of the first to internationally
recognize and congratulate Lula‚Äôs victory. [10] To illustrate, the most

retweet content in topic 18 (4,419 retweets) is: *Lula leads in all*
*states of the Northeast* . Furthermore, discussions also celebrate *the*
*victory of democracy*, reflecting disapproval of the previous Brazilian
president‚Äôs governance.
Some topics reveal the main themes that attracted attention
during the elections. For instance, topic 15 focuses on a recurring
theme consistently explored by far-right supporters: the possibility
of election fraud. Topics 4 and 17 underscore the spread of discussions surrounding the concept of the *third way*, an alternative
proposed by certain individuals aiming to circumvent the polarization between the two leading candidates, Lula and Bolsonaro.


This approach encourages voters to contemplate voting for candidates such as Simone Tebet and Ciro Gomes [11] . Topic 6 reflects the
controversial decisions taken during the period of the COVID-19
pandemic by Jair Bolsonaro‚Äôs government. [12]

Besides the discussion around the presidential candidates, our

16 raised questions about the apparent contradictions in the voting
patterns, where state voters gave victory to Lula as president while
simultaneously voting predominantly for far-right candidates for
the state government, deputies, and senators. Moreover, topics 9
and 20 are related with the increase of the number of elected female

candidates in 2022 elections.

Figure 2 shows the percentage of retweets per topic in each round.
As expected, some topics were more prominent in one election
round than in the other, due to the nature of the discussions. For
instance, the elections for the chamber of deputies and senators
(topics 8, 10, 16 and 18), as well as Lula‚Äôs victory (topics 1, 3, 11
and 13), were more prominent in specific rounds. However, some


topics were broadly discussed almost equally in both rounds (topics
2, 15, 19 and 20). Among these topics we highlight the topic 15,
which was related to possible frauds in the election, a theme highly
explored mainly by the far-right voters, through the dissemination
of fake news and misinformation about the matter. [13]

We now turn our attention to the psycholinguistic analysis of the
debate. Figure 3 shows the results. In the first round, we emphasize
the notable presence of words related to *home, money, assent, see*
*and sexual* . Retweets containing words associated with *home* often
depict individuals describing their voting experiences (leaving their

losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [15] Money related words
are mainly related to economical concerns. In the second round,
retweets frequently use words regarding *death, friend, religion* and
*positive emotion* . Interestingly, religion (moral and religious concerns) was actually a theme highly emphasized by Bolsonaro‚Äôs
campaign. [16] Positive emotions were probably expressed by the
Lula‚Äôs supporters due to his victory. Death, instead, was closely
related to the retweets regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the
way Bolsonaro‚Äôs government deals with it.

Finally, we focus on the sentiment analysis. Table 5 shows the
overall sentiment distribution of the retweets. Negative sentiments
dominate across both election rounds. However, the percentage
of positive retweets increases by 2.2 times in the second round,
corroborated by the increase in positive emotion-related words in
the retweets (see Figure 3).
We go further in our analysis by presenting the sentiment breakdown by topic. Figure 4 summarizes the *contrastive score*, calculated
as the difference between the fraction of positive and negative
retweets. Across both rounds, negative sentiment predominates

overall. Topics 3 and 14, regarding Lula‚Äôs victory, were exceptions
to this trend. The analysis captures an important insight regarding
the polarized nature of political debate, particularly on platforms
like Twitter [1, 7, 15].

**Table 5: Sentiment distribution (complete networks).**

**Date** **Ne** **g** **ative** **(** **%** **)** **Positive** **(** **%** **)** **Neutral** **(** **%** **)**

2nd Round 171,128 ( 53 *.* 3% ) 31,863 ( 9 *.* 9% ) 118,325 ( 36 *.* 8% )

*4.2.2* *Key Users‚Äô Dissemination.* We now turn our attention to the
content diffused by the *key users*, whose belong to the DF+NB
backbones. Their interactions extend beyond random occurrences,
being in the core of the discussion across the analyzed Twitter
networks.

Table 4 lists the top 20 topics retweeted by these users. Twelve of
these topics are the same as those shared by all users in the complete
networks, though they may appear in a different order. Analyzing
the complementary set of topics, we observe that these topics are
more related to Lula‚Äôs performance in the election, as well as to
some issues usually raised by the opposition to Bolsonaro, such as
concerns about previous government actions towards education,
health, and the COVID-19 crisis. We also note that the majority of
retweets in the top 20 for the backbones are related to discussing
or celebrating Lula‚Äôs victory.
Our data unveils interesting changes in the psycholinguistic
attributes of the content shared by users in the extracted backbones.
Figure 5 shows these results. Words related to *family* prevail in
the content shared by these users, mainly in the first round. To
better understanding what users shared in this topic, we manually
analyzed our data. These messages mainly mentioned Bolsonaro‚Äôs
family, which is strongly involved in politics and has been at the
center of several controversial situations reported by the media, as
well as family conflicts due to the political polarization, which was
a remarkable characteristic of 2022 Brazilian elections. Regarding
the second election round, retweets with *religion* related words
attracted more attention of these users.

**Table 6: Sentiment distribution (key users).**

Lastly, results on the sentiment analysis are shown in Figure
6 and Table 6. Key users tend to balance the shared content with
negative and neutral sentiments in both rounds. Unlike users from
the complete networks, key users shared more tweets with neutral

sentiments. Moreover, retweets shared in the second round tend to
be more positive than those shared by the overall users. Specifically,
we highlight topic 14, which pertains to Lula‚Äôs leadership in the
second round. These retweets are highly positive, suggesting strong
support from these users for the possibility of Lula‚Äôs victory.
*Takeaway.* The topics diffused by the users in backbones (core)
differ from the ones shared by the overall network (with peripheral
users as well). Interestingly, the most shared topics in backbones
that are not on the overall networks are more aligned with supporting Lula and celebrating his victory. Sentiments towards the
content are more positive in the second round, mainly considering the topic in which Lula‚Äôs victory is discussed (topic 14). The
percentage of negative retweets is smaller in the two rounds.

### **4.3 Persistence Analysis**

We next focus on understanding if the key users persist over time.
Specifically, we consider the users in DF+NB and analyze the dynamics of these users over the two election rounds.

A total of 624 users, representing 7% of users on the DF+NB
backbones, shared information across the two rounds. This small
percentage of users demonstrated significant activity, retweeting
almost 22% of the messages shared across the events of interest
for the backbones. All persistent users are non-verified users [17]

and they have, in general, more followers than the users in the
complete network. [18] Due to space constrains, we focus our final
discussion on the main topics persistent users boost the most within
Twitter networks. The most shared topics by the persistent users are
almost the same that those shared by the key users, except by one
topic with the following most discriminative words: *bahia, millions,*
*cleared, still, people, day, voting, missing, voted*, which focuses on
Lula‚Äôs leadership in the second round, with a significant margin of
votes in the state of Bahia.

17 Our data were collected previous the introduction of plans to buy the blue ticks.
18 We omitted the probability distribution due space constraints.


*Takeaway.* Although the set of persistent users is small (7%), our
results suggest that they play an important role in content diffusion
by the key users, accounting for 22% of the retweets. The topics
they share are almost identical to those shared by the key users, and
their potential to reach a larger audience is higher than that of users
in the complete networks, as they typically have more followers.
### **5 DISCUSSION**

The influence of online social networks on people‚Äôs actions and
beliefs has grown significantly over the past decade, impacting
everyday life. Regarding politics, these platforms provide citizens
with a way to voice their opinions and connect with other voters
through content dissemination. In this work, we characterized the
debate surrounding the Brazilian elections of 2022 on Twitter by
exploring the shared content among users‚Äô interactions. We conducted our analysis over two types of interactions: the weak ones,
which tend to be randomly made by the involved users (mainly on a
*noisy* network, such as Twitter), and the strong ones, which are consistently made by a set of core users. The core users were identified
through backbone extraction techniques found in the literature.
Our findings show that the topics, explored by the overall users
in both rounds, reflect individuals‚Äô opinions on election results,
controversies surrounding the previous government, and Brazilian
political events in general. Among the most shared topics by key
users, they largely retained the most widely disseminated topics,
though they diverged slightly by focusing on disseminating more
topics that supported Lula‚Äôs victory or discussed matters against
previous government decisions, particularly related to the pandemic period and government affairs such as health and education.
Persistent users, who actively engaged in the debate in both rounds,
are users with considerable numbers of followers and unverified
accounts. The main disseminated topics by them were almost the
same as the ones shared by the key users, underscoring this group as
a representation of the core network with significant responsibility
for the topics disseminated.
The prevalence of psycholinguistic attributes associated with
*home* (in the first round network) and *family* (in the key and persistent users group) was prominent in the initial round. However,
in the second round, there was an increase in the use of words
related to *death, positive emotion* and *religion* . These attributes align
with expectations regarding topics heavily discussed during these
elections, such as speeches focusing on religion and family and
their impact on the general voters, as well as the dissemination
of information and opinions on deaths during the pandemic and
Lula‚Äôs electoral victory. Negative sentiment prevailed in the debate,
characterized by contentious issues and high polarization, but the
dissemination by key users showed more balance, with a significant
percentage of neutral sentiment as well.
The main limitation of our analysis is due to the way we collected
our data. By utilizing a select set of keywords, chosen based on our
perceived representativeness as the event of interest, we were only
able to capture a partial view of the overall Twitter debate. Despite
this limitation, our work enriches the understanding of how the
2022 Brazilian elections were discussed on Twitter.
