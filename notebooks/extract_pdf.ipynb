Multimedia sensors are\\nan important data source in the Internet of Things (IoT), which\\nbrings the Internet of Media Things (IoMT) paradigm. Based on virtualization and IoMT, the concept of a multimedia Virtual Network\\nFunction (multimedia VNF) has been adopted to denote the virtualized representation of devices and also software components that\\nprocess multimedia streams. In many scenarios, multiple processes\\nmust be applied to multimedia streams in a predefined sequence,\\nthus creating the concept of multimedia Service Function Chain\\n(multimedia SFC). Few efforts have been made in the literature to\\ncreate a description language to support the definition of multimedia SFCs. In order to fill this gap, we propose a Domain Specific\\nLanguage (DSL) called L-PRISM. This DSL can be used as a conceptual base for developers to implement and virtualize multimedia\\napplications using multimedia VNFs. We also present a Proof of\\nConcept (PoC) that uses L-PRISM to run multimedia SFCs. Our\\nDSL and PoC were evaluated by software developers, and the results show that adopting L-PRISM facilitates the definition and\\ndeployment of multimedia SFCs based on multimedia VNFs.\\n### **KEYWORDS**\\n\\nIoMT, IoT, VNF, SFC, DSL, L-PRISM\\n### **1 INTRODUCTION**\\n\\nVirtualization is a concept that has paved the way for numerous\\nresearch studies in Cloud Computing, 5G, and IoT [ 14, 24 ]. This\\ntechnology not only reduces the costs of implementing and managing infrastructures, but also serves as a fundamental pillar in\\nparadigms such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV) [ 16, 19 ].\\nThe adoption of NFV and its Virtual Network Function (VNF) components has proved to be effective in reducing the consumption\\nof computational and network resources. Furthermore, virtualization increases the speed and efficiency of resource provisioning\\n\\nIn: Proceedings of the Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web (WebMe\\ndia’2024).

In [ 4 ], the authors explore the concept of virtual\\ndevices that abstract the heterogeneity of multimedia sensors and\\nintroduce virtual multimedia sensors (VMS), which we will refer to\\nas multimedia VNFs in our work. These VMSs enable multimedia\\n\\nstream processing using lightweight virtualization. Furthermore,\\nthe authors demonstrated the feasibility of using chained VMSs to\\ncreate complex multimedia stream processing pipelines. However,\\nthis characteristic was not fully explored in that work. Meanwhile,\\nin [ 11 ], the authors investigated the joint load balancing and autoscaling of multimedia VNFs in edge or cloud environments. In\\nthis context, virtualization concepts like NFV have been actively\\nintegrated into different studies to process multimedia streams.\\nThe Service Function Chain (SFC) is a sequence of sorted VNFs\\nassociated with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) [ 5 ]. By chaining\\nmultimedia functions, it is possible to create complex multimedia\\nstream processing pipelines. When the VNFs in an SFC are tailored\\nfor multimedia processing, they are referred to as multimedia SFCs.\\nDespite the potential of multimedia SFCs in various fields [ 9 ],\\nwe face the challenge of implementing and managing them easily,\\nsecurely, and efficiently. The components used to create multimedia\\nSFCs are typically developed by different entities using multiple\\ntechnologies [ 14 ]. Thus, to create a multimedia SFC, users must have\\na moderate level of knowledge of these technologies. Moreover, the\\ninteroperability of these components sometimes is often limited.\\nTo address these challenges, it is necessary to provide a layer\\nthat encapsulates the technical details of multimedia SFCs. There\\nare different alternatives for this, among which Domain-Specific\\nLanguages (DSLs) stand out [ 18 ]. Unlike other approaches, such as\\nmetamodels or conventional programming languages, DSLs offer\\ngreater flexibility and simplicity.\\nDSLs are language specifications designed to describe the characteristics, syntax, and behavior of systems in specific fields [ 15 ].\\nThese languages enable intuitive integration and management by\\nproviding an abstraction layer encapsulating technical details. This\\nallows users to focus on business logic and specific functionalities. In addition, DSLs facilitate the integration of new or external\\ncomponents more efficiently and less technically.\\nAlthough there have been significant advances in the literature\\nto facilitate the definition and deployment of NFV services, such as\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWebMedia’2024, Juiz de Fora, Brazil Ventura Quico et al.\\n\\n\\nthe TOSCA-NFV metamodel [ 22 ] or ETSI GS NFV-SOL [ 10 ], there\\nis still a considerable gap specifically regarding multimedia SFCs.\\nThe need to address multimedia SFCs separately arises from their\\nunique nature and challenges. Some of these challenges are (i) managing large-volume and high-speed data flows, (ii) synchronizing\\nmultiple formats and media types, and (iii) meeting requirements\\nfor real-time processing, which are not as critical in traditional\\nNFVs [ 17 ]. Furthermore, multimedia SFCs often require greater\\nflexibility in terms of scalability and adaptation of dynamic changes\\nin resource demand. Therefore, although existing models, such as\\nTOSCA-NFV, provide means to describe SFCs in general, the unique\\ncharacteristics of multimedia SFCs demand a specialized approach\\nthat directly addresses their specific requirements and inherent\\nchallenges.\\nIn this work, our aim is to fill this gap by proposing a DSL\\ncalled Language for Programming IoT Sensors for Multimedia (LPRISM), which serves as a conceptual foundation for describing\\nmultimedia SFCs, particularly in the emerging field of the IoMT.\\nThe decision to develop L-PRISM, instead of extending existing\\nsolutions like TOSCA-NFV, is driven by the unique demands of\\nmultimedia SFCs, such as the inherent complexity in their definition\\nand configuration, the need for flexibility in their components and\\nadaptability to specific environments.\\nOur DSL includes a data model that provides detailed structures\\nfor specifying the critical properties of multimedia SFCs. This model\\nenables the specification of the type, formats, and resolutions of\\ndata streams that multimedia VNFs can process and send, but it\\nalso considers scenarios where a multimedia VNF can handle its\\n\\nstreams in various formats and qualities. This aspect is crucial, as\\nthe computational and network requirements associated with a\\nmultimedia VNF are variable and depend on the characteristics of\\nthe multimedia stream to be processed.\\nThis information is vital for developers of multimedia SFCs, as it\\nprovides the necessary details to understand and utilize multimedia\\nVNFs. In turn, this will enable developers to specify their multimedia\\nSFCs efficiently. Additionally, at the application level, our data\\nmodel can facilitate the effective orchestration and management of\\nmultimedia SFCs, optimizing their lifecycle.\\nFurthermore, having a dedicated DSL presents several advantages, such as customization, facilitated implementation, and maintenance of its various components. The main contributions of this\\nwork are:\\n\\n  - L-PRISM makes it possible to describe a multimedia SFC\\nbased on a sequence of multimedia VNFs.\\n\\n  - L-PRISM defines the necessary structures for detailed logging of multimedia VNFs.\\n\\n  - L-PRISM makes using multimedia VNFs developed by third\\nparties easier, so developers of multimedia VNF-based solutions do not need to have advanced knowledge about the\\ntechnologies or tools used for developing the components\\nof a multimedia SFC.\\n\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2\\ndescribes the background and related work. Sections 3 and 4 present\\nL-PRISM and its metamodel. Section 5 describes our PoC. In Section\\n\\n6, we present an evaluation of our work. Section 7 brings our main\\nconclusions and future work.\\n\\n### **2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK**\\n\\nTraditional sensors, such as thermostats and presence detectors,\\ntypically produce discrete data in a readable format. However, multimedia sensors produce continuous, complex and large-volume\\ndata, which require high processing rates, massive storage, wide\\nbandwidth, low latency, and high energy consumption [ 17 ]. These\\ncharacteristics make their operation different from that of traditional sensors. One strategy to handle this complexity is to decouple\\nphysical sensors from multimedia stream consumers [4].\\nDifferent languages, metamodels, and DSLs have been developed,\\nwhich have helped develop systems and architectures, such as,\\nYANG [20], TOSCA-NFV [22] and ETSI GS NFV-SOL [10].\\nYANG [ 20 ] is a data modeling language used to describe network\\nconfigurations and telecommunication services. YANG can be used\\nfor NETCONF-based operations, including configuration, data state,\\nremote procedure calls (RPCs), and notifications. YANG models can\\nbe translated into XML syntax, allowing applications that use XML\\nparsers to operate and manipulate YANG models [ 6 ]. However,\\nYANG does not have features required to describe multimedia SFCs.\\nA specific data model that works with virtualization technologies is TOSCA-NFV [ 22 ], which allows describing, deploying, and\\nmanaging applications and services based on NFV. TOSCA-NFV describes in detail the components of its solutions and the interactions\\nand dependencies between them. TOSCA is a modeling language\\nthat uses the template concept to describe the components of a\\nworkload using a topology template, and their relationships using\\na relationship template [22]. It is crucial to note that TOSCA-NFV\\nfocuses primarily on traditional virtualization systems and does\\nnot align well with lightweight virtualization platforms, such as\\nDocker and Kubernetes.\\n\\nMininet-NFV [ 8 ] presents an advanced framework for NFV orchestration, facilitating the implementation and operation of VNFbased network services. This framework is built upon Mininet, a\\ntool widely recognized for its capability in agile experimentation\\nwith networks, SDN and NFV, and extensively used for prototyping,\\ntesting, and implementing NFV solutions. Additionally, MininetNFV supports parameterized TOSCA-NFV templates, using virtual\\nlink descriptors to define detailed and flexible network configurations.\\n\\nETSI GS NFV-SOL 001 [ 10 ] adapts TOSCA-NFV to meet the\\nspecification requirements of ETSI GS NFV IFA 011 [ 1 ] and 014 [ 2 ]\\nfor Virtualized Network Function Descriptors (VNFDs), Network\\nService Descriptors (NSDs), and Physical Network Function Descriptors (PNFDs). Like TOSCA-NFV, it specifies requirements for\\nthe management and orchestration of VNFs.\\nAlthough very related to our proposal, neither TOSCA-NFV nor\\nETSI NFV-SOL specifically addresses the requirements of multimedia applications and systems, particularly concerning multimedia\\nSFCs and their components. Therefore, while our work is based on\\nthe principles of TOSCA-NFV, it stands out by addressing the necessary aspects for the definition, orchestration, and management of\\nmultimedia SFCs implemented on lightweight virtualization platforms.\\n\\nTable 1 compares related languages, templates, and data models\\nthat support the definition of SFCs. The last row of the table presents\\nL-PRISM. The meaning of each column in the table are as follows:\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nA Domain-Specific Language for Multimedia Service Function Chains based on Virtualization of Sensors WebMedia’2024, Juiz de Fora, Brazil\\n\\n  - **IoMT:** Focus on Internet of Media Things applications.\\n\\n  - **Edge Computing:** Tailored for edge computing environ\\nments.\\n\\n  - **Light Virtualization:** Support for lightweight virtualization\\nplatforms.\\n\\n\\n**Table 1: Comparison between related work.**\\n\\n\\n|Related Work|IoMT|Edge Computing|Light Virtualization|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|YANG [20]|-|-|-|\\n|TOSCA-NFV [22]|-|✓|-|\\n|Mininet-NFV [8]|-|✓|✓|\\n|ETSI NFV-SOL [10]|-|✓|✓|\\n|L-PRISM|✓|✓|✓|\\n\\n\\nOur previous work [ 3, 4 ] proposed an architecture, which allows the execution and management of multimedia VNFs based\\non lightweight virtualization in an edge-cloud environment. However, at that time, we did not explore multimedia SFCs or provided\\na domain-specific language to describe multimedia SFCs, which\\nwould make the creation and maintenance of multimedia SFCs easier. In this work, we fill in this gap by simplifying the definition of\\nmultimedia SFCs through the development of a DSL.\\n### **3 L-PRISM**\\n\\nThis section presents L-PRISM, a DSL that facilitates the description of multimedia SFCs based on multimedia VNFs. L-PRISM is\\n\\nmainly based on the architecture proposed in [ 3 ] and the TOSCANFV metamodel [ 22 ]. L-PRISM was developed following the stages\\nproposed by Negm et al. [18], detailed in the following sections.\\n### **3.1 Domain Analysis**\\n\\nAn analysis of multimedia applications in virtualized environments\\nwas carried out. It allowed us to understand and abstract the main\\ncharacteristics that influence the operation of these types of application. The characteristics represent configurable aspects such as\\nthe allocation of computing and network resources, communication\\nrequirements, etc.\\nIn addition, an analysis of the interaction between multimedia\\napplications was performed. These interactions can be modeled as\\ndirected graphs, representing complex multimedia applications. We\\ndescribe these complex applications as *multimedia SFCs* and their\\ncomponents as *multimedia VNFs* .\\n### **3.2 L-PRISM Design**\\n\\nL-PRISM was created following the concepts presented in [ 4 ] as a\\nreference. Thus, the design of L-PRISM considers the implementation of *multimedia SFCs* in distributed environments composed of\\nedge and cloud nodes. In addition, L-PRISM was coined to operate\\non lightweight virtualization platforms, such as Docker and Kubernetes. Figure 1 shows an example of a multimedia SFC. The main\\ncomponents of a multimedia SFC are:\\n\\n\\n**Figure 1: Example of a multimedia SFC.**\\n\\n  - *Virtual Device (VD)* is the virtual representation of a physical\\nmultimedia device.\\n\\n  - *Multimedia VNF / VMS* is a function that process the multimedia streams. Unlike VDs, instances of multimedia VNFs\\nare created exclusively for each multimedia SFC.\\n\\n  - *Virtual Links (VL)* provide the communication between (i)\\nVDs and multimedia VNFs, (ii) different multimedia VNFs\\nand (iii) multimedia VNFs and endpoints (user applications).\\n\\nL-PRISM is a flexible language that can be used in compiled\\nand interpreted scenarios. In both cases, the user describes the\\nmultimedia SFC using our proposed language. In a compilationbased scenario, the compiler will create a low-level code that will be\\nprocessed to execute the multimedia SFCs. In an interpreted-based\\nscenario, which is the case of our PoC, an interpreter runs over the\\ncode and creates/instantiates the multimedia SFCs.\\nThe L-PRISM language is based on YAML to provide readability,\\nflexibility, cross-platform support, integration with existing tools,\\nand a fast learning curve [23]. These features make L-PRISM intuitive and easy to use, and in turn, YAML is tailored to our specific\\nneeds and helps to make our DSL easily accepted by developers.\\nL-PRISM follows a model-driven approach. Figure 2 presents\\nthe L-PRISM metamodel, defining its components, attributes, and\\nthe relationships between them. For example, the *swImage* (Image\\nof the multimedia VNF) structure in the metamodel of our DSL\\nallows for detailed description of the type, formats, and resolutions\\nof multimedia streams that a multimedia VNF can process and emit.\\nThis information at the application level can be stored in a database,\\nwhich can then be accessed by developers of multimedia SFCs. This\\nwill enable them to understand the characteristics of multimedia\\nVNFs generally and efficiently specify each component of their\\nmultimedia SFCs.\\nFor an extensive overview of L-PRISM, visit our website [1] .\\n### **4 THE L-PRISM METAMODEL**\\n\\nThis section summarizes the L-PRISM metamodel.

This API did\\nnot support multimedia SFC, thus a new endpoint was added to the\\nALFA 2.0 API. This new endpoint receives and processes a YAML\\nfile that contains the multimedia SFC described using L-PRISM.\\nTo manage multimedia SFCs, multiple tasks must be performed.\\nThe new endpoint executes commands using the Docker API and\\nthe ALFA API to create VMSs. After that, the virtual devices are\\nlinked to the VMSs, and interconnections between VMSs are cre\\nated.\\n### **5.3 Web Client**\\n\\nALFA API allows different software to interact with the entity of\\nthe platform. The ALFA implementation already has a Web Client\\nto manage the VMSs. Thus, we extended the original web-based\\nclient by adding a new component that allows the upload of a file\\nwith the multimedia SFC description using the L-PRISM language.\\nFigure 4 shows the web client interface used to send the file with\\nthe multimedia SFC description. The Web client presents the VMSs,\\nVirtual Devices, and nodes running in the environment. The figure\\nalso shows the result of the multimedia stream processed by the\\ncreated multimedia SFC.\\n\\n**Figure 4: Web interface for executing L-PRISM files in ALFA**\\n**2.0.**\\n### **6 EVALUATION**\\n\\nThis section describes the L-PRISM evaluation. The experiment\\nwas carried out with computer science students. We asked them\\nto create multimedia SFCs with L-PRISM and also using a manual\\ndeployment.\\n\\n### **6.1 Goal Question Metric**\\n\\nThe experiment aims to evaluate L-PRISM during the development\\nof multimedia SFCs. The Goal Question Metric (GQM) methodology\\nwas adopted in the process [12]. Table 7 presents our goals.\\n\\n**Table 7: Evaluation goals.**\\n\\n|Goal|Description|Perspective|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|G1|Analyze the application engineering process with and without L-PRISM to evaluate the efficiency and productivity of developing multimedia SFC.|Efficiency and Productivity|\\n|G2|Evaluate the comprehensibility of L- PRISM to analyze if variables, attributes, and structures are understandable for the participants.|Usability|\\n\\n|#Q|Description|Metrics|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Q1|Is the application engineering process us- ing L-PRISM effective in terms of time for developing multimedia SFC, compared to the traditional approach (ALFA)?|M1 - De- velopment effort|\\n|Q2|Does the developer claim that using L- PRISM makes it easier to understand the functional and non-functional require- ments of the multimedia SFC?|M2 - Un- derstanding of require- ments|\\n|Q3|Does the developer claim that using L- PRISM helps create multimedia SFC?|M3 - Per- ceived ease of use|\\n|Q4|Does the developer claim that L-PRISM is useful to create multimedia SFC?|M4 - Per- ceived utility|\\n|Q5|Does the developer claim that using L- PRISM makes it easier to reuse the multi- media SFC created with L-PRISM to create new multimedia SFC?|M5 - Per- ceived reuse|\\n|Q6|Is the process of modifying multimedia SFC faster with L-PRISM compared with the traditional method (ALFA)?|M6 - Reuse effort|\\n\\n\\nThe questions for *𝐺* 1 were adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [ 21 ]. The goal was to quantitatively evaluate\\nthe multimedia SFC development process using L-PRISM and the\\ntraditional method. Metrics *𝑀* 2 *, 𝑀* 3 *, 𝑀* 4 and *𝑀* 5 were measured\\nusing the Likert scale (1 - strongly disagree to 5 - strongly agree)\\n\\n[ 13 ], and for metrics *𝑀* 1 and *𝑀* 6, the time in minutes required to\\nperform each task was requested.\\nFor goal *𝐺* 2, seven questions ( *𝑄* 1 − *𝑄* 7 ) related to Cognitive Dimensions of Notations (CDN) [ 7 ] were used. This approach helped\\nus evaluate L-PRISM from a usability point of view. Table 9 presents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor *𝐺* 1, six questions related to efficiency and productivity in\\nthe process of developing multimedia SFCs were raised.

To perform this task, it will\\nbe necessary to use *VMS_merge* that will receive the multimedia\\nstream processed by *VMS_gray* and subscribe to *VD_color_bar* to\\nreceive the original stream, *VMS _gray* will need to subscribe to\\n*VD_color_bar* in order to process this multimedia stream and send\\nit to *VMS_merge* . Finally, *VMS_merge* will publish the result to a\\nnetwork point ( *𝐼𝑃* and *𝑃𝑂𝑅𝑇* ).\\n\\n*6.2.3* *𝑇* 3 *.* This task consists of adding the *VD_video_ball* multimedia stream to *𝑇* 2. It is necessary to create a new *VMS_merge*\\nthat will receive the result of *𝑇* 2 through one of its ports, and the\\nother port will subscribe to *VD_video_ball* . Finally, it will publish\\nits result in a given network point ( *𝐼𝑃* and *𝑃𝑂𝑅𝑇* ). The visual result\\nof *𝑇* 3 is presented in the bottom-right part of Figure 4, while Figure\\n5 illustrates the corresponding multimedia SFC.\\n\\n*6.2.4* *𝑇* 4 *.* This task consists of replicating *𝑇* 3, changing the final\\ndestination port to where the final stream is sent. The idea is to be\\nable to visualize two identical multimedia SFCs, created in *𝑇* 3 and\\n*𝑇* 4, running at the same time.\\n\\n**Figure 5: Model of task 3.**\\n### **6.3 Participants**\\n\\nIn order to carry on user experiments, the consent of each participant was requested through a Free and Informed Consent Form\\n(FICF) and all collected data was anonymized. All responses were\\ncollected through a Google Forms questionnaire. No personal or\\nsensible data was collected from participants, except their gender\\nand age. Computer science students were invited to participate.\\nFifteen participants aged 20-39 years accepted our invitation. They\\nwere 14 men and 1 woman. Their academic degree was: seven\\nwere undergraduate, three were graduate, and five post-graduate\\nstudents. We asked their level of experience on XML, JSON and\\nYAML (from 1 (no experience) to 5 (a lot of experience)). The median answers were 4 for XML, 5 for JSON, and 3 for YAML. We\\nbuilt a testbed with edge nodes in our lab to run the experiments.\\nEight participants did it physically in the lab and seven participants\\ndid it remotely. All of them were observed all the time during the\\nexperiment, even the remote ones.\\n### **6.4 Analysis of Results**\\n\\nThe results of our evaluation are presented in Figure 6. Our evaluation focuses on determining whether L-PRISM is efficient, productive, and easy to use.\\nQuestions *𝑄* 2 to *𝑄* 5 of G1 are related to the productivity of\\nL-PRISM. Figure 6(a) shows that the results of these questions\\n\\n\\nFor the evaluation of L-PRISM, four tasks ( *𝑇* 1 − *𝑇* 4 ) were proposed,\\nwhich had to be carried out using our L-PRISM proposal and a\\ntraditional method using our previous implementation with manual\\nconfiguration through the web client interface. For the tasks to be\\ncompleted, additional material was prepared and is available at the\\nL-PRISM website [4] . The site contains information about L-PRISM\\nand different examples of how to implement multimedia SFCs with\\nL-PRISM and the traditional method used for these tests.\\n\\nThe types of components available for this experiment were\\ntwo virtual devices. The first device produces a video of a white\\nsphere bouncing on a black box, which we called *VD_video_ball*,\\nand the second device produces a video of colored bars, which we\\ncalled *VD_color_bar* . Three types of multimedia VNFs were also\\nmade available, namely (i) a multimedia VNF that transforms a\\ncolor video to grayscale called *VMS_gray*, (ii) a multimedia VNF\\nthat only transfers UDP-UDP data and does not apply any changes\\nto the original stream, called *VMS_udp*, and (iii) a multimedia VNF\\nthat merges video-type media streams, grabbing two multimedia\\nstreams and transforming them into one, called *VMS_merge* . The\\ntasks are detailed as follows.\\n\\n*6.2.1* *𝑇* 1 *.* This task is to develop a simple multimedia SFC, where\\n*VMS_gray* will need to subscribe to the *VD_color_bar* to process\\nthe multimedia stream and publish the result to a point within the\\nnetwork ( *𝐼𝑃* and *𝑃𝑂𝑅𝑇* ).\\n\\n4 https://fventuraq.github.io/lprism.html\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWebMedia’2024, Juiz de Fora, Brazil Ventura Quico et al.\\n\\n\\nare positive and the responses expected to validate L-PRISM were\\npositive. With this, we can conclude that the *𝐺* 1 goal was achieved.\\nQuestions *𝑄* 1 and *𝑄* 6 are related to efficiency. To answer *𝑄* 1,\\nFigure 6(b) shows the average time in minutes it took for participants to complete each task with both methods (L-PRISM and\\nTraditional), with a confidence interval of 90%. It can be seen that\\nTasks 1, 2, and 3 have similar times, although the learning curve to\\nlearn a new language is much greater than the use of an intuitive\\ninterface, L-PRISM is equivalent to the traditional method for new\\ndevelopers of multimedia SFCs.\\nIn the case of Task 4, L-PRISM has proven to be superior to the\\ntraditional method. This is because developers came to understand\\nL-PRISM better with the previous tasks, and most developers perceived that they could reuse the code from Task 3 for Task 4. This\\ntask also answers *𝑄* 6 of *𝐺* 1, which focuses on evaluating if L-PRISM\\nallows the reuse of an already created multimedia SFC. As it can be\\nseen in Figure 6(b), using L-PRISM, participants completed Task 4\\nin an average time 77.8% shorter than with the traditional method,\\ndue to L-PRISM code reuse.\\n\\nThe answers to the G2 questions related to the cognitive dimensions are presented in Figure 6(c). It should be noted that, except\\nfor *𝑄* 3 about language diffuseness (verbosity), where a negative\\nresponse was expected, all the others had positive feedback from\\nthe subjects. As it can be seen, the responses for Q3 are somewhat\\nambiguous. A subsequent consultation was made with the participants asking about this result and the conclusion was that the\\nquestion was not very clear for them, hence the disparity in the\\n\\nresponses.\\nAs mentioned above, the objectives of our evaluation were to\\ndemonstrate that L-PRISM is efficient, productive, and easy to use.\\nMoreover, based on the results obtained, we can conclude that goals\\n*𝐺* 1 and *𝐺* 2 were achieved.\\n### **7 CONCLUSION**\\n\\nThis work presented L-PRISM, a DSL to specify multimedia SFCs\\nbased on multimedia VNFs. We also extended the ALFA platform\\nwith the ability to execute SFCs described with L-PRISM. This extension is available in our GitHub [5] repository, where the installation\\nguide and all necessary resources for installing, executing, and\\ntesting our work are provided.\\nWe evaluated L-PRISM, and the results confirmed that our proposal language is efficient, productive, and easy to use. One observation we made was that the learning curve was shorter for the\\ntraditional model, as it focused on learning to use a specific application. In contrast, the learning curve for L-PRISM largely depended\\non the user’s prior experience with programming languages; those\\nwith more experience adapted to our language more quickly and,\\ntherefore, completed tasks faster.\\nFinally, the practical applicability of L-PRISM will mainly depend on multimedia VNFs, as these are the core components of\\nmultimedia SFCs and are responsible for processing multimedia\\nstreams. L-PRISM can be used to deploy applications such as virtual/augmented reality, live streaming, surveillance systems, and\\n\\nmore.\\n\\n5 Source code of alfa 2.0 https://github.com/fventuraq/alfa\\n\\n\\n(a) Participant Responses for Questions Q2-Q5 of G1.\\n\\n(b) Time needed per task in L-PRISM and Traditional methods.\\n\\n(c) Participant Responses for G2 Questions.\\n\\n**Figure 6: Evaluation results.**\\n\\nAs future work, we intend to develop a graphical tool to create/edit SFCs designed with L-PRISM, offering an intuitive user\\ninterface to visualize and modify their topology.

Multimedia sensors are an important data source in the Internet of Things (IoT), which brings the Internet of Media Things (IoMT) paradigm. Based on virtualization and IoMT, the concept of a multimedia Virtual Network Function (multimedia VNF) has been adopted to denote the virtualized representation of devices and also software components that process multimedia streams. In many scenarios, multiple processes must be applied to multimedia streams in a predefined sequence, thus creating the concept of multimedia Service Function Chain (multimedia SFC). Few efforts have been made in the literature to create a description language to support the definition of multimedia SFCs. In order to fill this gap, we propose a Domain Specific Language (DSL) called L-PRISM. This DSL can be used as a conceptual base for developers to implement and virtualize multimedia applications using multimedia VNFs. We also present a Proof of Concept (PoC) that uses L-PRISM to run multimedia SFCs. Our DSL and PoC were evaluated by software developers, and the results show that adopting L-PRISM facilitates the definition and deployment of multimedia SFCs based on multimedia VNFs. ### **KEYWORDS**  IoMT, IoT, VNF, SFC, DSL, L-PRISM ### **1 INTRODUCTION**  Virtualization is a concept that has paved the way for numerous research studies in Cloud Computing, 5G, and IoT . This technology not only reduces the costs of implementing and managing infrastructures, but also serves as a fundamental pillar in paradigms such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV) . The adoption of NFV and its Virtual Network Function (VNF) components has proved to be effective in reducing the consumption of computational and network resources. Furthermore, virtualization increases the speed and efficiency of resource provisioning  In: Proceedings of the Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web (WebMe dia’2024). Juiz de Fora, Brazil. Porto Alegre: Brazilian Computer Society, 2024. © 2024 SBC – Brazilian Computing Society. ISSN 2966-2753  ## Anselmo L. E. Battisti ####  Fluminense Federal University Niterói, RJ, Brazil ## Flavia C. Delicato ####  Fluminense Federal University Niterói, RJ, Brazil  in cloud and edge environments, facilitating the management and orchestration of these resources . Many investigations combine NFV technology with multimedia stream processing. In , the authors explore the concept of virtual devices that abstract the heterogeneity of multimedia sensors and introduce virtual multimedia sensors (VMS), which we will refer to as multimedia VNFs in our work. These VMSs enable multimedia  stream processing using lightweight virtualization. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of using chained VMSs to create complex multimedia stream processing pipelines. However, this characteristic was not fully explored in that work. Meanwhile, in , the authors investigated the joint load balancing and autoscaling of multimedia VNFs in edge or cloud environments. In this context, virtualization concepts like NFV have been actively integrated into different studies to process multimedia streams. The Service Function Chain (SFC) is a sequence of sorted VNFs associated with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) . By chaining multimedia functions, it is possible to create complex multimedia stream processing pipelines. When the VNFs in an SFC are tailored for multimedia processing, they are referred to as multimedia SFCs. Despite the potential of multimedia SFCs in various fields , we face the challenge of implementing and managing them easily, securely, and efficiently. The components used to create multimedia SFCs are typically developed by different entities using multiple technologies . Thus, to create a multimedia SFC, users must have a moderate level of knowledge of these technologies. Moreover, the interoperability of these components sometimes is often limited. To address these challenges, it is necessary to provide a layer that encapsulates the technical details of multimedia SFCs. There are different alternatives for this, among which Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) stand out . Unlike other approaches, such as metamodels or conventional programming languages, DSLs offer greater flexibility and simplicity. DSLs are language specifications designed to describe the characteristics, syntax, and behavior of systems in specific fields . These languages enable intuitive integration and management by providing an abstraction layer encapsulating technical details. This allows users to focus on business logic and specific functionalities. In addition, DSLs facilitate the integration of new or external components more efficiently and less technically. Although there have been significant advances in the literature to facilitate the definition and deployment of NFV services, such as   11   -----  WebMedia’2024, Juiz de Fora, Brazil Ventura Quico et al.   the TOSCA-NFV metamodel  or ETSI GS NFV-SOL , there is still a considerable gap specifically regarding multimedia SFCs. The need to address multimedia SFCs separately arises from their unique nature and challenges. Some of these challenges are (i) managing large-volume and high-speed data flows, (ii) synchronizing multiple formats and media types, and (iii) meeting requirements for real-time processing, which are not as critical in traditional NFVs . Furthermore, multimedia SFCs often require greater flexibility in terms of scalability and adaptation of dynamic changes in resource demand. Therefore, although existing models, such as TOSCA-NFV, provide means to describe SFCs in general, the unique characteristics of multimedia SFCs demand a specialized approach that directly addresses their specific requirements and inherent challenges. In this work, our aim is to fill this gap by proposing a DSL called Language for Programming IoT Sensors for Multimedia (LPRISM), which serves as a conceptual foundation for describing multimedia SFCs, particularly in the emerging field of the IoMT. The decision to develop L-PRISM, instead of extending existing solutions like TOSCA-NFV, is driven by the unique demands of multimedia SFCs, such as the inherent complexity in their definition and configuration, the need for flexibility in their components and adaptability to specific environments. Our DSL includes a data model that provides detailed structures for specifying the critical properties of multimedia SFCs. This model enables the specification of the type, formats, and resolutions of data streams that multimedia VNFs can process and send, but it also considers scenarios where a multimedia VNF can handle its  streams in various formats and qualities. This aspect is crucial, as the computational and network requirements associated with a multimedia VNF are variable and depend on the characteristics of the multimedia stream to be processed. This information is vital for developers of multimedia SFCs, as it provides the necessary details to understand and utilize multimedia VNFs. In turn, this will enable developers to specify their multimedia SFCs efficiently. Additionally, at the application level, our data model can facilitate the effective orchestration and management of multimedia SFCs, optimizing their lifecycle. Furthermore, having a dedicated DSL presents several advantages, such as customization, facilitated implementation, and maintenance of its various components. The main contributions of this work are:    L-PRISM makes it possible to describe a multimedia SFC based on a sequence of multimedia VNFs.    L-PRISM defines the necessary structures for detailed logging of multimedia VNFs.    L-PRISM makes using multimedia VNFs developed by third parties easier, so developers of multimedia VNF-based solutions do not need to have advanced knowledge about the technologies or tools used for developing the components of a multimedia SFC.  The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the background and related work. Sections 3 and 4 present L-PRISM and its metamodel. Section 5 describes our PoC. In Section  6, we present an evaluation of our work. Section 7 brings our main conclusions and future work.  ### **2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK**  Traditional sensors, such as thermostats and presence detectors, typically produce discrete data in a readable format. However, multimedia sensors produce continuous, complex and large-volume data, which require high processing rates, massive storage, wide bandwidth, low latency, and high energy consumption . These characteristics make their operation different from that of traditional sensors. One strategy to handle this complexity is to decouple physical sensors from multimedia stream consumers . Different languages, metamodels, and DSLs have been developed, which have helped develop systems and architectures, such as, YANG , TOSCA-NFV  and ETSI GS NFV-SOL . YANG  is a data modeling language used to describe network configurations and telecommunication services. YANG can be used for NETCONF-based operations, including configuration, data state, remote procedure calls (RPCs), and notifications. YANG models can be translated into XML syntax, allowing applications that use XML parsers to operate and manipulate YANG models . However, YANG does not have features required to describe multimedia SFCs. A specific data model that works with virtualization technologies is TOSCA-NFV , which allows describing, deploying, and managing applications and services based on NFV. TOSCA-NFV describes in detail the components of its solutions and the interactions and dependencies between them. TOSCA is a modeling language that uses the template concept to describe the components of a workload using a topology template, and their relationships using a relationship template . It is crucial to note that TOSCA-NFV focuses primarily on traditional virtualization systems and does not align well with lightweight virtualization platforms, such as Docker and Kubernetes.  Mininet-NFV  presents an advanced framework for NFV orchestration, facilitating the implementation and operation of VNFbased network services. This framework is built upon Mininet, a tool widely recognized for its capability in agile experimentation with networks, SDN and NFV, and extensively used for prototyping, testing, and implementing NFV solutions. Additionally, MininetNFV supports parameterized TOSCA-NFV templates, using virtual link descriptors to define detailed and flexible network configurations.  ETSI GS NFV-SOL 001  adapts TOSCA-NFV to meet the specification requirements of ETSI GS NFV IFA 011  and 014  for Virtualized Network Function Descriptors (VNFDs), Network Service Descriptors (NSDs), and Physical Network Function Descriptors (PNFDs). Like TOSCA-NFV, it specifies requirements for the management and orchestration of VNFs. Although very related to our proposal, neither TOSCA-NFV nor ETSI NFV-SOL specifically addresses the requirements of multimedia applications and systems, particularly concerning multimedia SFCs and their components. Therefore, while our work is based on the principles of TOSCA-NFV, it stands out by addressing the necessary aspects for the definition, orchestration, and management of multimedia SFCs implemented on lightweight virtualization platforms.  Table 1 compares related languages, templates, and data models that support the definition of SFCs. The last row of the table presents L-PRISM. The meaning of each column in the table are as follows:   12   -----  A Domain-Specific Language for Multimedia Service Function Chains based on Virtualization of Sensors WebMedia’2024, Juiz de Fora, Brazil    **IoMT:** Focus on Internet of Media Things applications.    **Edge Computing:** Tailored for edge computing environ ments.    **Light Virtualization:** Support for lightweight virtualization platforms.   **Table 1: Comparison between related work.**   |Related Work|IoMT|Edge Computing|Light Virtualization| |---|---|---|---| |YANG |-|-|-| |TOSCA-NFV |-|✓|-| |Mininet-NFV |-|✓|✓| |ETSI NFV-SOL |-|✓|✓| |L-PRISM|✓|✓|✓|   Our previous work  proposed an architecture, which allows the execution and management of multimedia VNFs based on lightweight virtualization in an edge-cloud environment. However, at that time, we did not explore multimedia SFCs or provided a domain-specific language to describe multimedia SFCs, which would make the creation and maintenance of multimedia SFCs easier. In this work, we fill in this gap by simplifying the definition of multimedia SFCs through the development of a DSL. ### **3 L-PRISM**  This section presents L-PRISM, a DSL that facilitates the description of multimedia SFCs based on multimedia VNFs. L-PRISM is  mainly based on the architecture proposed in  and the TOSCANFV metamodel . L-PRISM was developed following the stages proposed by Negm et al. , detailed in the following sections. ### **3.1 Domain Analysis**  An analysis of multimedia applications in virtualized environments was carried out. It allowed us to understand and abstract the main characteristics that influence the operation of these types of application. The characteristics represent configurable aspects such as the allocation of computing and network resources, communication requirements, etc. In addition, an analysis of the interaction between multimedia applications was performed. These interactions can be modeled as directed graphs, representing complex multimedia applications. We describe these complex applications as *multimedia SFCs* and their components as *multimedia VNFs* . ### **3.2 L-PRISM Design**  L-PRISM was created following the concepts presented in  as a reference. Thus, the design of L-PRISM considers the implementation of *multimedia SFCs* in distributed environments composed of edge and cloud nodes. In addition, L-PRISM was coined to operate on lightweight virtualization platforms, such as Docker and Kubernetes. Figure 1 shows an example of a multimedia SFC. The main components of a multimedia SFC are:   **Figure 1: Example of a multimedia SFC.**    *Virtual Device (VD)* is the virtual representation of a physical multimedia device.    *Multimedia VNF / VMS* is a function that process the multimedia streams. Unlike VDs, instances of multimedia VNFs are created exclusively for each multimedia SFC.    *Virtual Links (VL)* provide the communication between (i) VDs and multimedia VNFs, (ii) different multimedia VNFs and (iii) multimedia VNFs and endpoints (user applications).  L-PRISM is a flexible language that can be used in compiled and interpreted scenarios. In both cases, the user describes the multimedia SFC using our proposed language. In a compilationbased scenario, the compiler will create a low-level code that will be processed to execute the multimedia SFCs. In an interpreted-based scenario, which is the case of our PoC, an interpreter runs over the code and creates/instantiates the multimedia SFCs. The L-PRISM language is based on YAML to provide readability, flexibility, cross-platform support, integration with existing tools, and a fast learning curve . These features make L-PRISM intuitive and easy to use, and in turn, YAML is tailored to our specific needs and helps to make our DSL easily accepted by developers. L-PRISM follows a model-driven approach. Figure 2 presents the L-PRISM metamodel, defining its components, attributes, and the relationships between them. For example, the *swImage* (Image of the multimedia VNF) structure in the metamodel of our DSL allows for detailed description of the type, formats, and resolutions of multimedia streams that a multimedia VNF can process and emit. This information at the application level can be stored in a database, which can then be accessed by developers of multimedia SFCs. This will enable them to understand the characteristics of multimedia VNFs generally and efficiently specify each component of their multimedia SFCs. For an extensive overview of L-PRISM, visit our website  . ### **4 THE L-PRISM METAMODEL**  This section summarizes the L-PRISM metamodel. Table 2 presents the attributes of a *𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙*, which describes a multimedia SFC. It should be noted that attributes ending with an (*) are mandatory. Table 3 describes the attributes of the *𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒* component, which is a virtual representation of a physical device (camera or microphone). One advantage of virtualized devices is that a single multimedia stream captured from a camera/microphone can be reused multiple times and sent to different destinations.  1    13   -----  WebMedia’2024, Juiz de Fora, Brazil Ventura Quico et al.  **Figure 2: Class diagram of the L-PRISM metamodel.**   **Table 2: Attributes of a** ***chainModel*** **in L-PRISM**      **Table 4: Attributes of multimedia VNF (** ***vms*** **) in L-PRISM**    |Name|Type|Description| |---|---|---| |chainName*|String|Name of the multimedia SFC.| |chainDescription|String|Multimedia SFC description.| |devices*|map|List of virtual devices (𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒) that compose the multimedia SFC.| |vmss*|map|List of multimedia VNFs (𝑣𝑚𝑠) that compose the multimedia SFC.| |virtualLinks*|map|List of 𝑣𝑖𝑟𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑘𝑠 between device and multimedia VNF (vms).|     **Table 3: Attributes of** ***device*** **in L-PRISM**  |Name|Type|Description| |---|---|---| |deviceName*|String|Unique name of a virtual device that works as an ID in a virtualLink.| |deviceId*|String|Identifies a virtualized .

It has one video source (VD 2) that is handled by a VNF (Multimedia VNF 1) that sends the video stream to the final application (192.168.0.101 Port 1002).

ALFA uses containers to run VMSs and virtual devices thus allowing language independence. Our PoC named ALFA 2.0 is released under the MIT License. The source code is available  . ### **5.1 Database**  ALFA uses a non-relational database (mongoDB) to store information about VMSs, Virtual Devices, Edge Nodes, VMS types, and Device types. To extend its functionality, we added the L-PRISM components, such as *chain model*, to the database. The chain model  2 Source code available at  3 Source code of alfa 2.0    15   -----  WebMedia’2024, Juiz de Fora, Brazil Ventura Quico et al.   stores information about each created multimedia SFC, such as which VMSs are used within a multimedia SFC, which devices are used, and the connections between them. In addition to these changes, some attributes were modified and added to the already defined components, such as VMS, VD, Edge Node, VMS types, and Device type. These new attributes helps ALFA 2.0 to support the L-PRISM specification. With these changes, it is possible to create, and manage multimedia SFCs defined using L-PRISM inside ALFA 2.0. ### **5.2 API**  The ALFA implementation already has an API that is used to manage the entities responsible for executing the VMSs. This API did not support multimedia SFC, thus a new endpoint was added to the ALFA 2.0 API. This new endpoint receives and processes a YAML file that contains the multimedia SFC described using L-PRISM. To manage multimedia SFCs, multiple tasks must be performed. The new endpoint executes commands using the Docker API and the ALFA API to create VMSs. After that, the virtual devices are linked to the VMSs, and interconnections between VMSs are cre ated. ### **5.3 Web Client**  ALFA API allows different software to interact with the entity of the platform. The ALFA implementation already has a Web Client to manage the VMSs. Thus, we extended the original web-based client by adding a new component that allows the upload of a file with the multimedia SFC description using the L-PRISM language. Figure 4 shows the web client interface used to send the file with the multimedia SFC description. The Web client presents the VMSs, Virtual Devices, and nodes running in the environment. The figure also shows the result of the multimedia stream processed by the created multimedia SFC.  **Figure 4: Web interface for executing L-PRISM files in ALFA** **2.0.** ### **6 EVALUATION**  This section describes the L-PRISM evaluation. The experiment was carried out with computer science students. We asked them to create multimedia SFCs with L-PRISM and also using a manual deployment.  ### **6.1 Goal Question Metric**  The experiment aims to evaluate L-PRISM during the development of multimedia SFCs. The Goal Question Metric (GQM) methodology was adopted in the process . Table 7 presents our goals.  **Table 7: Evaluation goals.**  |Goal|Description|Perspective| |---|---|---| |G1|Analyze the application engineering process with and without L-PRISM to evaluate the efficiency and productivity of developing multimedia SFC.|Efficiency and Productivity| |G2|Evaluate the comprehensibility of LPRISM to analyze if variables, attributes, and structures are understandable for the participants.|Usability|  |#Q|Description|Metrics| |---|---|---| |Q1|Is the application engineering process using L-PRISM effective in terms of time for developing multimedia SFC, compared to the traditional approach (ALFA)?|M1 Development effort| |Q2|Does the developer claim that using LPRISM makes it easier to understand the functional and non-functional requirements of the multimedia SFC?|M2 Understanding of requirements| |Q3|Does the developer claim that using LPRISM helps create multimedia SFC?|M3 Perceived ease of use| |Q4|Does the developer claim that L-PRISM is useful to create multimedia SFC?|M4 Perceived utility| |Q5|Does the developer claim that using LPRISM makes it easier to reuse the multimedia SFC created with L-PRISM to create new multimedia SFC?|M5 Perceived reuse| |Q6|Is the process of modifying multimedia SFC faster with L-PRISM compared with the traditional method (ALFA)?|M6 Reuse effort|   The questions for *𝐺* 1 were adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) . The goal was to quantitatively evaluate the multimedia SFC development process using L-PRISM and the traditional method. Metrics *𝑀* 2 *, 𝑀* 3 *, 𝑀* 4 and *𝑀* 5 were measured using the Likert scale (1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree)  , and for metrics *𝑀* 1 and *𝑀* 6, the time in minutes required to perform each task was requested. For goal *𝐺* 2, seven questions ( *𝑄* 1 − *𝑄* 7 ) related to Cognitive Dimensions of Notations (CDN)  were used. This approach helped us evaluate L-PRISM from a usability point of view. Table 9 presents     For *𝐺* 1, six questions related to efficiency and productivity in the process of developing multimedia SFCs were raised. Table 8 presents the G1 questions and the metrics related to them.  **Table 8: Questions and metrics for goal** ***G1*** **.**          16   -----  A Domain-Specific Language for Multimedia Service Function Chains based on Virtualization of Sensors WebMedia’2024, Juiz de Fora, Brazil   the proposed questions for *𝐺* 2 and the respective metrics. Those questions should be answered using the Likert scale, for *𝑄* 3 and *𝑄* 4 (1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree) and for *Q1, Q2, Q5, Q6* and *𝑄* 7 (1 very difficult to 5 very easy) .  **Table 9: Questions and metrics for goal** ***G2*** **.**          |#Q|Description|Metrics| |---|---|---| |Q1|How easy is it to visualize or find the different elements and attributes of L-PRISM when creating or changing a multimedia SFC?|M1 Visibility| |Q2|How easy is modifying a multimedia SFC with L-PRISM?|M2 Viscosity| |Q3|Is the L-PRISM language too verbose to specify a multimedia SFC?|M3 Diffuseness| |Q4|How well do the L-PRISM elements and attributes represent a multimedia SFC?|M4 Closeness of Mapping| |Q5|How easy is it to understand the structures and data types of L-PRISM?|M5 Role Expressiveness| |Q6|There are structures and data types in LPRISM that can be closely related, and changes in one can affect the other. Are these dependencies easy to be seen?|M6 Hidden dependencies| |Q7|Does L-PRISM generally seem easy or difficult to understand (for example, when changing different elements of a multimedia SFC)?|M7 Hard mental operations|  ### **6.2 Procedure**    *6.2.2* *𝑇* 2 *.* This task compares a raw multimedia stream with the same processed multimedia stream. To perform this task, it will be necessary to use *VMS_merge* that will receive the multimedia stream processed by *VMS_gray* and subscribe to *VD_color_bar* to receive the original stream, *VMS _gray* will need to subscribe to *VD_color_bar* in order to process this multimedia stream and send it to *VMS_merge* . Finally, *VMS_merge* will publish the result to a network point ( *𝐼𝑃* and *𝑃𝑂𝑅𝑇* ).  *6.2.3* *𝑇* 3 *.* This task consists of adding the *VD_video_ball* multimedia stream to *𝑇* 2. It is necessary to create a new *VMS_merge* that will receive the result of *𝑇* 2 through one of its ports, and the other port will subscribe to *VD_video_ball* . Finally, it will publish its result in a given network point ( *𝐼𝑃* and *𝑃𝑂𝑅𝑇* ). The visual result of *𝑇* 3 is presented in the bottom-right part of Figure 4, while Figure 5 illustrates the corresponding multimedia SFC.  *6.2.4* *𝑇* 4 *.* This task consists of replicating *𝑇* 3, changing the final destination port to where the final stream is sent. The idea is to be able to visualize two identical multimedia SFCs, created in *𝑇* 3 and *𝑇* 4, running at the same time.  **Figure 5: Model of task 3.** ### **6.3 Participants**  In order to carry on user experiments, the consent of each participant was requested through a Free and Informed Consent Form (FICF) and all collected data was anonymized. All responses were collected through a Google Forms questionnaire. No personal or sensible data was collected from participants, except their gender and age. Computer science students were invited to participate. Fifteen participants aged 20-39 years accepted our invitation. They were 14 men and 1 woman. Their academic degree was: seven were undergraduate, three were graduate, and five post-graduate students. We asked their level of experience on XML, JSON and YAML (from 1 (no experience) to 5 (a lot of experience)). The median answers were 4 for XML, 5 for JSON, and 3 for YAML. We built a testbed with edge nodes in our lab to run the experiments. Eight participants did it physically in the lab and seven participants did it remotely. All of them were observed all the time during the experiment, even the remote ones. ### **6.4 Analysis of Results**  The results of our evaluation are presented in Figure 6. Our evaluation focuses on determining whether L-PRISM is efficient, productive, and easy to use. Questions *𝑄* 2 to *𝑄* 5 of G1 are related to the productivity of L-PRISM. Figure 6(a) shows that the results of these questions   For the evaluation of L-PRISM, four tasks ( *𝑇* 1 − *𝑇* 4 ) were proposed, which had to be carried out using our L-PRISM proposal and a traditional method using our previous implementation with manual configuration through the web client interface. For the tasks to be completed, additional material was prepared and is available at the L-PRISM website  . The site contains information about L-PRISM and different examples of how to implement multimedia SFCs with L-PRISM and the traditional method used for these tests.  The types of components available for this experiment were two virtual devices. The first device produces a video of a white sphere bouncing on a black box, which we called *VD_video_ball*, and the second device produces a video of colored bars, which we called *VD_color_bar* . Three types of multimedia VNFs were also made available, namely (i) a multimedia VNF that transforms a color video to grayscale called *VMS_gray*, (ii) a multimedia VNF that only transfers UDP-UDP data and does not apply any changes to the original stream, called *VMS_udp*, and (iii) a multimedia VNF that merges video-type media streams, grabbing two multimedia streams and transforming them into one, called *VMS_merge* . The tasks are detailed as follows.  *6.2.1* *𝑇* 1 *.* This task is to develop a simple multimedia SFC, where *VMS_gray* will need to subscribe to the *VD_color_bar* to process the multimedia stream and publish the result to a point within the network ( *𝐼𝑃* and *𝑃𝑂𝑅𝑇* ).  4    17   -----  WebMedia’2024, Juiz de Fora, Brazil Ventura Quico et al.   are positive and the responses expected to validate L-PRISM were positive. With this, we can conclude that the *𝐺* 1 goal was achieved. Questions *𝑄* 1 and *𝑄* 6 are related to efficiency. To answer *𝑄* 1, Figure 6(b) shows the average time in minutes it took for participants to complete each task with both methods (L-PRISM and Traditional), with a confidence interval of 90%. It can be seen that Tasks 1, 2, and 3 have similar times, although the learning curve to learn a new language is much greater than the use of an intuitive interface, L-PRISM is equivalent to the traditional method for new developers of multimedia SFCs. In the case of Task 4, L-PRISM has proven to be superior to the traditional method. This is because developers came to understand L-PRISM better with the previous tasks, and most developers perceived that they could reuse the code from Task 3 for Task 4. This task also answers *𝑄* 6 of *𝐺* 1, which focuses on evaluating if L-PRISM allows the reuse of an already created multimedia SFC. As it can be seen in Figure 6(b), using L-PRISM, participants completed Task 4 in an average time 77.8% shorter than with the traditional method, due to L-PRISM code reuse.  The answers to the G2 questions related to the cognitive dimensions are presented in Figure 6(c). It should be noted that, except for *𝑄* 3 about language diffuseness (verbosity), where a negative response was expected, all the others had positive feedback from the subjects. As it can be seen, the responses for Q3 are somewhat ambiguous. A subsequent consultation was made with the participants asking about this result and the conclusion was that the question was not very clear for them, hence the disparity in the  responses. As mentioned above, the objectives of our evaluation were to demonstrate that L-PRISM is efficient, productive, and easy to use. Moreover, based on the results obtained, we can conclude that goals *𝐺* 1 and *𝐺* 2 were achieved. ### **7 CONCLUSION**  This work presented L-PRISM, a DSL to specify multimedia SFCs based on multimedia VNFs. We also extended the ALFA platform with the ability to execute SFCs described with L-PRISM. This extension is available in our GitHub  repository, where the installation guide and all necessary resources for installing, executing, and testing our work are provided. We evaluated L-PRISM, and the results confirmed that our proposal language is efficient, productive, and easy to use. One observation we made was that the learning curve was shorter for the traditional model, as it focused on learning to use a specific application. In contrast, the learning curve for L-PRISM largely depended on the user’s prior experience with programming languages; those with more experience adapted to our language more quickly and, therefore, completed tasks faster. Finally, the practical applicability of L-PRISM will mainly depend on multimedia VNFs, as these are the core components of multimedia SFCs and are responsible for processing multimedia streams. L-PRISM can be used to deploy applications such as virtual/augmented reality, live streaming, surveillance systems, and  more.  5 Source code of alfa 2.0    (a) Participant Responses for Questions Q2-Q5 of G1.
