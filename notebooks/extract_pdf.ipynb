This is especially evident in Brazil, where these platforms have been instrumental in disseminating political content rapidly and widely. In this work, we aim to understand how the political debate surrounding the Brazilian elections of 2022 on Twitter unfolds through different levels of user engagement. We provide a content analysis that unveils the main topics discussed by different users, regardless of the strength of their interactions. Our results enrich the understanding of how online discussions evolved on social media during this important event in the recent history of democracy in Brazil. ### **',\n",

       " 'text': 'INTRODUCTION Online Social Media Platforms (OSMPs) have served as one of the main stages for the organization and development of many significant social movements worldwide, from health [8, 21] to politics [9, 34]. Platforms such as (former) Twitter [1] [30], WhatsApp [25, 26, 29] and Telegram [37], have been the focus of many works that aimed to analyze how information is disseminated in such platforms and its implications to societies. This scenario is no different in Brazil, where OSMPs have been mainly used for political debates. Several studies in the literature [3, 4, 10, 12, 16, 17, 20, 27, 29, 31, 34, 37] characterized the Brazilian political debates across a variety of platforms. In contrast to previous work that focused on Twitter, we here provide a more comprehensive analysis of the Brazilian political landscape of 2022 by using network modeling and backbone extraction methods to show how the political debate unfolds through different levels of user engagement and diffusion. To accomplish this, we crawled Twitter to collect about 741K shared tweets covering the days of the two election. We then model the information spread during 1 Twitter has been recently rebranded as X. Yet, we maintain the reference to the old platform´s name as our study relies on features commonly associated with it. In: Proceedings of the Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web (WebMe dia’2024). Juiz de Fora, Brazil. Porto Alegre: Brazilian Computer Society, 2024. © 2024 SBC – Brazilian Computing Society.

These users are placed in the core of the media-centric network, thereby driving the election debate on Twitter. Finally, we analyzed the text shared by the users from three different (yet complementary) perspectives: topic extraction, sentiment analysis, and psycholinguistic analysis. Our main findings are as follows: (i) The identification of backbone networks reveals a set of users engaged through stronger interactions. This structured network may prompt these users to act more cohesively in promoting specific content, thereby influencing discourse on a particular topic. (ii) The topics diffused by users in backbones differ from those shared by the overall network. Interestingly, the most shared topics in these backbones, not present in the overall network, are more aligned with supporting the candidate Luis Inácio Lula da Silva and celebrating his victory. (iii) There is a small set of users who shared a significant amount of information across both election rounds, with a higher potential to reach a larger audience due to their above-average number of followers in our dataset. ### 2 RELATED WORK Our work is not the first to examine the Brazilian political scenario on OSMPs. The authors in [25, 26] analyzed the messages exchanged on WhatsApp during the 2018 Brazilian general elections. Similar to our work, the authors built a network based on users that shared the same content messages in one or more groups. They also employed backbone extraction techniques to search for strongly connected user communities to evidence possible coordination actions in sharing specific content. In the same direction, Machado et al. [20] explored misinformation in WhatsApp content during the same election period. The main results showed that viral content in WhatsApp groups was mainly based on hate speech and fake news. In [3], the authors characterized the tweets of preelection advertisement for the 2016, 2018 and 2020 elections. By applying psycholinguistic and sentiment analysis techniques, the results showed that early advertisements are usually negative or neutral, with the neutral sentiment growing over time, and there is a pattern in the use of hashtags and links, along with mentions to entities. Focusing specifically on the 2022 Brazilian elections, the study of Venâncio et al . [37] applied the methodology of backbone extraction 283 ----- WebMedia’2024, Juiz de Fora, Brazil Larissa Malagoli, Giovana Piorino, Carlos H. G. Ferreira, and Ana Paula Couto da Silva to search for evidences of coordination in the information dissemi nation on Telegram. This study not only highlighted the growing influence of messaging apps on political mobilization, but also contributed to the understanding of digital communication strategies in modern electoral contexts. The authors in [23] collected data from an online experiment where participants built personalized government programs by combining policies proposed by the candidates of the 2022 French and Brazilian presidential elections, identifying polarizing proposals. Santana et al. presented a study that analyzed the use and engagement of the TikTok profiles of the two leading candidates: Lula and Bolsonaro [31]. The authors in [17] applied sentiment analysis in order to identify gender bias on comments on YouTube in the 2018 and 2022 elections. In the context of Twitter, Silva and Faria [34] analyzed the sentiments expressed by Twitter users regarding the presidential candidates, with the aim of verifying whether the candidates’ performance is related to their popularity on social media. The authors in [32] analyzed the opinions of Brazilians about the candidates using machine learning techniques. The work in [4] investigated how sentiment analysis was a prominent factor in interpreting the possible relationship between the opinions of social media users and the final result of the 2018 elections in Brazil. Paiva et al. focused on understanding how some feminist causes were addressed during the elections [27]. Finally, the authors in [16] developed a methodology, which is a similar approach used in our work, to discover the contribution of specific groups to network polarization. The investigation we offer here complements the aforementioned studies and greatly builds on their findings by offering a broader set of analysis on a large Twitter dataset. We rely on backbone extraction methods to show how the political debate unfolds through different levels of users’ engagement. Our results enrich the understanding of how online discussions evolved on social media during this important event in the recent history of democracy in Brazil. ### 3 METHODOLOGY This section describes our methodology, including data collection, modeling and analysis. ### 3.1 Dataset We collect Portuguese-language tweets shared during the two rounds of 2022 Brazilian general elections, occurred on October 2 [𝑛𝑑], 2022 and October 30 [𝑡ℎ], 2022. The collection was done using the Twitter API Search. [2] We built a list of keywords that include terms such as the official election keyword used by the Twitter and the most important presidential candidates. Specifically, we consider the following list of keywords: Eleições2022 [3] , Lula, Bolsonaro, Ciro, SimoneTebet . [4] Table 1 show the total number of unique tweets and retweets for each keyword, after filtering tweets with at least two users in the dataset that retweeted that message. Furthermore, tweets with the same ID that contain multiple keywords were counted only once. We analyzed approximately 741K shared tweets across 2 https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/search/apireference/get-search-tweets 3 Elections2022 4 These candidates accounted for over 98% of all votes. the two election rounds. As expected, in our dataset the official Twitter general election keyword ( Eleições2022 ) is the most shared one, followed by the keywords with the name of the two main presidential candidates. Table 1: First and Second Round Datasets. Keywords First Round Second Round # Unique # Unique # Retweets # Retweets Tweets Tweets Elei ç ões2022 2,145 186,594 875 153,525 Bolsonaro 3,771 154,165 2,716 112,840 Lula 3,094 100,066 2,930 96,546 Ciro 1,705 44,185 445 11,995 SimoneTebet 4 64 4 197 Total 8,774 409,956 5,835 331,175 To provide a first overview of our data, we look into the contents of the collected retweets. We do so by showing in Figure 1 the word clouds with the top 100 most frequent words (in numbers of the retweets) during the first and second election rounds. In the first round (Figure 1.a) we note that elections related words are predominant, such as vote and president . Interestingly, the term electronic voting machine is also one of the most used terms, probably due to the suspicion about its credibility raised by the supporters of Jair Bolsonaro candidate. [5] During the second round word cloud (Figure 1.b), we observe the presence of words celebrating the victory of the Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, such as victory, lulapresidente2022, democracy . Finally, it is worth noting the presence of the word Northeast in both election rounds, which is a Brazilian region in which Lula has many supporters. [6] ### 3.2 Network Modeling To investigate the 2022 election debate on Twitter, we employed a network model, known as media-centric network, which connects users who shared similar content [5, 18, 25, 26]. By analyzing the properties of such media-centric networks, we are able to determine which actors contribute the most to content propagation. We built two graphs, where each graph represents a mediacentric network capturing the user sharing patterns during each election round. In each graph 𝐺 ( 𝑉, 𝐸 ), a node 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 corresponds to a user who retweeted a tweet, and an undirected edge 𝑒 =( 𝑣 𝑖, 𝑣 𝑗 ) is included in 𝐸 if the users corresponding to 𝑣 𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗 shared the same tweet (exactly the same textual content) at least once. The weight of 𝑒 is the number of tweets both users shared in common. The total amount of retweets shared across each network is the sum of all edge weights. ### 3.3 Key Users Identification In addition to providing a general overview of content dissemination on Twitter, the media-centric network model allows us to identify the group of users who frequently share the same pieces of 5 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/world/americas/election-bolsonaro-brazilfraud.html?smid=url-share 6 https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/politica/nordeste-e-a-unicaregiao-em-que-lula-obteve-mais-votos-que-bolsonaro-confira/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/01/brazil-election-how-lula-won-therunoff-from-sao-paulo-to-the-north-east 284 ----- Twitter and the 2022 Brazilian Elections Portrait: A Network and Content-Driven Analysis WebMedia’2024, Juiz de Fora, Brazil (a) First Round. (b) Second Round. Figure 1: Retweets’ word clouds. information, thereby driving the election debate on Twitter. Here, we denote these users as key users . We next focus on finding pairs of users whose sharing patterns are non-random (strong). In other words, we filter out noisy or sporadic edges, revealing only pairs of users whose shared tweets deviate disproportionately from the expected number of content shares. To that end, we used the DF+NB network backbone extraction method from the literature to filter out weaker edges, thus retaining only stronger edges [18]. DF+NB method combines the Disparity Filter method [25, 33] with the concept of Neighborhood Overlap. Specifically, DF considers as reference model for a user sharing content independently of the others a uniform distribution of the edge weights incident to the corresponding node. Thus, an edge ( 𝑣 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑗 ) is retained in the backbone if its weight greatly deviates (from a statistical point of view) from this reference model for both 𝑣 𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗 . This method effectively highlights edges that demonstrate consistent and repeated behavior between pairs of users. With the Neighborhood Overlap filter, DF+NB goes further by removing peripheral and bridge connections, focusing on edges between users with common neighbors who also share similar patterns of content dissemination. DF+NB showed to be more effective in scenarios with high levels of noise, as data collected from Twitter [18]. To parametrize the DF+NB method, we set 𝛼 = 0 . 05, which represents the evidence of the existence of users whose shared same content [13]. This parameter is the p-value used to test against the assumption of uniform distribution for independent behavior. For the filter based on the neighborhood overlap metric, we assume the threshold given by the 95 [𝑡ℎ] percentile of the neighborhood overlap distribution. After extracting the backbone of each graph, we applied the widely used Louvain community detection algorithm [2] to identify and analyze patterns of user groupings and their organization in each backbone. The goal of the Louvain algorithm is to maximize community modularity, which is a key metric representing the density of connections within communities compared to a hypothetical random network. Modularity values range from -0.5 to +1, with higher scores (above 0.3) indicating well-defined community structures [24]. ### 3.4 Content Analysis Besides identifying the key users who shared a high volume of similar information during the two election rounds, we are also interested in characterizing what they were talking about. In other words, this study focuses on retweets to analyze content dissemination and user behavior in the electoral context. To achieve this, we analyzed the text shared by them from three different (yet complementary) perspectives: topic extraction, sentiment analysis, and psycholinguistic analysis. 3.4.1 Topic Extraction. To identify the debated topics, we applied the BERTopic model [14], which was proved to be one of the best models for the analysis of short-text data [6]. The process of BERTopic begins with converting a collection of retweets into vector representations using the BERTimbau, a Portuguese language pre-trained model as a base for the transformer in order to improve the performance [11, 22, 28, 35]. Subsequently, the dimensionality of these vectors is reduced using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Re- duction (UMAP) technique, enhancing the efficiency of subsequent clustering processes. Following the dimensionality reduction, the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm groups these low-dimensional vector representations into clusters based on semantic similarities. These clusters (or documents) are then analyzed using the Class-based Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (c-TF-IDF) technique to identify distinctive words for each cluster, thereby defining the topics associated with each group of retweets. Here, the Maxi- mal Marginal Relevance (MMR) parameter was applied in order to achieve better diversification between the topics’ keywords. This parameter limits the number of duplicated words among the topics, comparing word embeddings with topic embedding. It also leads to a less occurrence of synonyms among the topics, making them more concise and avoiding redundancy. For the parameterization, we followed the recommendations in the BERTopic documentation to find a balanced compromise between the number of topics and the size of the dataset. [7] As a result, we obtain the following parameterization: the number of neighbors and the component parameters required by UMAP were set to 10 and 5, respectively. The minimum topic size was set to 5, which controls the minimum number of unique retweets on a topic. The minimum number of words required to visualize topics contents was set to 20, in order to inform broader content about the topics’ subjects and their relation to the elections. Finally, MMR was adjusted to 0.6 (on a scale of 0 to 1). 7 https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/ 285 ----- WebMedia’2024, Juiz de Fora, Brazil Larissa Malagoli, Giovana Piorino, Carlos H. G.
